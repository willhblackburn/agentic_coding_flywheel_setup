# Beads - AI-Native Issue Tracking

Welcome to Beads! This repository uses **Beads** for issue tracking - a modern, AI-native tool designed to live directly in your codebase alongside your code.

## What is Beads?

Beads is issue tracking that lives in your repo, making it perfect for AI coding agents and developers who want their issues close to their code. No web UI required - everything works through the CLI and integrates seamlessly with git.

## Quick Start

### Essential Commands

```bash
# Create new issues
bd create "Add user authentication"

# View all issues
bd list

# View issue details
bd show <issue-id>

# Update issue status
bd update <issue-id> --status in_progress
bd update <issue-id> --status done

# Sync with git remote
bd sync
```

## Daemon (Optional)

Beads has an optional background daemon (`bd daemon`) that auto-syncs issues with git.

In this repo, the sync branch is configured as `main`. Running the daemon while you are on a different branch can cause `.beads/issues.jsonl` to be rewritten from `main`, leaving your working tree dirty and blocking `git pull --rebase`.

Recommended workflow:
- Prefer manual sync: `bd sync` (default).
- If you use the daemon, run it only while you are on `main`, or run it in local-only mode: `bd daemon --start --local`.
- If `.beads/issues.jsonl` is changing unexpectedly, check/stop the daemon: `bd daemon --status` / `bd daemon --stop`.

### Working with Issues

Issues in Beads are:
- **Git-native**: Stored in `.beads/issues.jsonl` and synced like code
- **AI-friendly**: CLI-first design works perfectly with AI coding agents
- **Branch-aware**: Issues can follow your branch workflow
- **Always in sync**: Auto-syncs with your commits
