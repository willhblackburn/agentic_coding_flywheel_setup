By then, they've either proceeded on faith or dropped off.\n\nBeginners need to understand:\n- VPS = a computer in a datacenter that runs 24/7\n- Your laptop = the remote control\n- Why this matters: persistent sessions, agents keep running, work from any device\n- Account vs Instance: signing up for Hetzner ≠ having a running server\n\nThe region selection and RAM requirements are also opaque. \"Pick a region close to you\" - why? \"16GB RAM\" - what does that mean in practical terms?\n\n## User Story\nAs someone considering ACFS,\nI want to understand why I need a VPS and what it does,\nSo that I can make an informed decision and understand the architecture.\n\n## Success Criteria\n1. User understands the laptop ↔ VPS relationship before committing\n2. User understands persistence benefit (work continues when laptop closes)\n3. User understands provider account vs VPS instance distinction\n4. User understands region selection (closer = faster)\n5. User understands RAM requirements (more RAM = more agents)\n\n## Scope\n- Add \"Why VPS?\" section early in wizard (before rent-vps step)\n- Clarify account vs instance in rent-vps → create-vps transition\n- Improve region and RAM explanations with practical context\n- Use the \"engine room\" metaphor earlier and consistently\n\n## Dependencies\nNone - can be developed in parallel with Terminal epic\n\n## UI/UX Requirements  \n- Maintain current polish for desktop and mobile\n- Consider an animated diagram showing laptop → internet → VPS\n- Use Jargon component for technical terms\n- Ensure explanations don't make the wizard feel longer (progressive disclosure)\n\n## Technical Approach\n1. Add \"Why VPS?\" content to rent-vps page or a new interstitial\n2. Enhance create-vps page with better RAM/region explanations\n3. Add transition text between rent-vps and create-vps clarifying the distinction\n4.

The ssh-keygen prompts are designed for sysadmins, not beginners.

When they inevitably forget it, they're stuck and have to regenerate keys.\n\nThe ~/.ssh path is also completely foreign - users don't know what ~ means or that .ssh is a hidden folder.\n\n## User Story  \nAs a beginner generating my first SSH key,\nI want clear guidance on exactly what to do at each prompt,\nSo that I create a working key without accidentally locking myself out.\n\n## Success Criteria\n1.

{"id":"agentic_coding_flywheel_setup-25i","title":"Task: Set up MDX rendering pipeline","description":"# Set Up MDX Rendering Pipeline\n\n## Parent Feature\nLearning Hub Core Infrastructure (tor)\n\n## Goal\nConfigure the webapp to render MDX content from the lesson markdown files with proper styling and React component support.\n\n## Why MDX\nThe lesson files in `acfs/onboard/lessons/` are standard Markdown. MDX allows us to:\n1. Render markdown with React components\n2. Add interactive elements (CommandCard, Jargon tooltips)\n3. Style code blocks with syntax highlighting\n4. Maintain a single source of truth\n\n## Recommended Approach: next-mdx-remote\n\n### Installation\n```bash\ncd apps/web\nbun add next-mdx-remote\nbun add -d @types/mdx\n```\n\n### Configuration\n\n#### 1. Create MDX utilities\n```typescript\n// lib/mdx.ts\nimport { compileMDX } from 'next-mdx-remote/rsc';\nimport { readFile } from 'fs/promises';\nimport path from 'path';\n\n// Custom components for MDX content\nconst components = {\n  // Override default elements\n  pre: (props) =\u003e \u003cpre className=\"overflow-x-auto rounded-lg bg-muted p-4\" {...props} /\u003e,\n  code: (props) =\u003e \u003ccode className=\"rounded bg-muted px-1 py-0.5 font-mono text-sm\" {...props} /\u003e,\n  \n  // Add custom components\n  CommandCard: dynamic(() =\u003e import('@/components/command-card').then(m =\u003e m.CommandCard)),\n  Jargon: dynamic(() =\u003e import('@/components/jargon').then(m =\u003e m.Jargon)),\n  GuideTip: dynamic(() =\u003e import('@/components/simpler-guide').then(m =\u003e m.GuideTip)),\n};\n\nexport async function loadLesson(filename: string) {\n  const filePath = path.join(process.cwd(), '..', '..', 'acfs', 'onboard', 'lessons', filename);\n  const source = await readFile(filePath, 'utf-8');\n  \n  const { content, frontmatter } = await compileMDX\u003c{ title?: string }\u003e({\n    source,\n    components,\n    options: {\n      parseFrontmatter: true,\n      mdxOptions: {\n        remarkPlugins: [],\n        rehypePlugins: [],\n      },\n    },\n  });\n  \n  return { content, frontmatter };\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Syntax Highlighting\nAdd syntax highlighting for code blocks:\n```bash\nbun add rehype-highlight\n# or for more control:\nbun add shiki rehype-pretty-code\n```\n\nConfigure in mdx options:\n```typescript\nimport rehypeHighlight from 'rehype-highlight';\n\nmdxOptions: {\n  rehypePlugins: [rehypeHighlight],\n}\n```\n\n### Alternative: Static Import\nIf lesson content doesn't change often, we could:\n1. Copy markdown to `apps/web/content/lessons/`\n2. Use `@next/mdx` with app directory\n\nPros: Simpler, better type safety\nCons: Duplicate content, manual sync needed\n\n## File Structure\n```\napps/web/\n├── lib/\n│   └── mdx.ts              # MDX loading utilities\n├── app/\n│   └── learn/\n│       └── [slug]/\n│           └── page.tsx    # Uses loadLesson()\n```\n\n## Testing\n1. Create test page that loads one lesson\n2. Verify markdown renders correctly\n3. Verify code blocks have syntax highlighting\n4. Verify custom components work\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Can load markdown files from `acfs/onboard/lessons/`\n- [ ] Markdown renders with proper styling\n- [ ] Code blocks have syntax highlighting\n- [ ] Custom components (CommandCard, etc.) work in MDX\n- [ ] Tables render correctly\n- [ ] Images render (if any)\n\n## Considerations\n- **Build time**: MDX compilation happens at build/request time\n- **Caching**: Consider caching compiled MDX for performance\n- **Path resolution**: Monorepo paths need care (../../acfs/)\n\n## File Changes\n- Create: `apps/web/lib/mdx.ts`\n- Update: `apps/web/package.json` (add dependencies)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-21T18:20:00.986245-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-21T18:25:39.612428-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-21T18:25:39.612428-05:00","close_reason":"Completed as part of tor using react-markdown + remark-gfm + rehype-highlight instead of next-mdx-remote (simpler approach, same result)","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"agentic_coding_flywheel_setup-25i","depends_on_id":"agentic_coding_flywheel_setup-tor","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-21T18:24:07.370556-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

{"id":"agentic_coding_flywheel_setup-2cvc","title":"[EPIC] Daily Workflow \u0026 Getting Started Guide","description":"# Epic: Daily Workflow \u0026 Getting Started Guide\n\n## Problem Statement\nUsers complete the wizard and land on the celebration page, but then have NO IDEA what to do next. The wizard ends, but their journey is just beginning. Critical gaps:\n\n1. **No daily workflow explained**: How do I start working each day? SSH in, then what?\n\n2. **tmux/ntm confusion**: What is tmux? Why do I need it? What is ntm? The concepts are introduced without adequate context.\n\n3. **Project creation mystery**: How do I start my OWN project? The wizard uses \"my-first-project\" but doesn't explain the general pattern.\n\n4. **File system disorientation**: Where are my files? How do I find things? How do I navigate?\n\n5. **Manual editing unknown**: What if Claude gets something wrong? How do I fix files myself?\n\n## Background \u0026 Reasoning\nThis is arguably the most critical gap in the entire user experience. The wizard successfully gets users SET UP, but doesn't teach them how to USE the system. They have a powerful engine room but no operator's manual.\n\nThe \"Your First 5 Minutes\" section on the final page helps, but it's not enough. Users need:\n- A mental model for daily workflow\n- Understanding of persistence (why tmux/ntm matter)\n- Confidence to start their own projects\n- Basic navigation skills\n\n## User Story\nAs a user who just completed setup,\nI want to understand how to use my new environment daily,\nSo that I can start building projects with confidence.\n\n## Success Criteria\n1. User knows their daily workflow: SSH → ntm attach → work\n2. User understands why tmux sessions matter (persistence)\n3. User can create a new project from scratch\n4. User can navigate the filesystem (cd, lsd, etc.)\n5. User knows how to manually edit files if needed\n6. User knows how to get back in if they close their laptop\n\n## Scope\n- Create \"Your Daily Workflow\" guide section\n- Expand \"Getting Back In\" section\n- Add \"Starting a New Project\" guide\n- Add \"Finding Your Way Around\" filesystem basics\n- Add \"Manual Editing\" section (nano, or VS Code Remote)\n- Enhance Learning Hub with these practical guides\n\n## Dependencies\n- Epic E: Authentication (user must be authenticated)\n- Epic G: Post-Install Transition (user must be reconnected as ubuntu)\n\n## UI/UX Requirements\n- Maintain current polish for desktop and mobile\n- Consider a dedicated \"Getting Started\" page vs cramming into celebration page\n- Workflow should be presented as numbered steps\n- Include visual diagrams of the workflow loop\n- Mobile: ensure code examples are copyable\n\n## Technical Approach\n1. Expand launch-onboarding page with comprehensive \"Next Steps\"\n2. Create new /learn/getting-started page with full guide\n3. Add filesystem basics to Linux Basics lesson\n4. Add workflow diagram (SSH → ntm → cc → work → detach → exit)\n5. Add manual editing section with nano instructions\n6. Consider VS Code Remote SSH setup guide as optional advanced content\n\n## Estimated Effort\nLarge (multiple pages, significant new content)\n\n## Priority Justification\nP0 (Critical) - Without this, users complete setup but cannot actually USE the system.

But the VPS has no browser! The tool outputs a URL that the user must manually open on their laptop. This flow is:\n\n1. Not explained anywhere in the wizard\n2. Confusing when it says \"Opening browser...\" but nothing happens\n3. Even more confusing if xdg-open is installed and fails silently\n\nAdditionally, the accounts page shows too many services at once, and subscription requirements (Claude Pro, ChatGPT Pro) aren't prominent enough.\n\n## Background \u0026 Reasoning\nOAuth flows in CLI tools assume a local machine with a browser. Headless servers require the \"device flow\" where a URL is displayed for manual opening. Users need to:\n\n1. See the URL in the terminal\n2. Copy it\n3. Paste into their laptop's browser\n4. Complete the OAuth flow\n5. Return to terminal\n\nThis is standard for developers but completely foreign to beginners. Without guidance, they'll think the auth failed.\n\n## User Story\nAs a beginner authenticating services on my VPS,\nI want to understand the device authentication flow,\nSo that I can successfully connect my accounts without confusion.\n\n## Success Criteria\n1. User understands that VPS has no browser\n2. User knows to copy the URL and paste in laptop browser\n3. User knows to return to terminal after browser auth completes\n4. User understands which services need paid subscriptions\n5. User feels safe skipping non-essential services\n\n## Scope\n- Add \"Headless Authentication\" explanation to status-check page\n- Enhance accounts page to de-emphasize optional services\n- Add subscription requirement warnings prominently\n- Add \"What happens if I skip?\" reassurance\n- Consider reordering: Essential only by default, expand for more\n\n## Dependencies\n- Epic D: First SSH Connection (user must be connected to VPS)\n\n## UI/UX Requirements\n- Maintain current polish for desktop and mobile\n- Use AlertCard for the headless auth explanation\n- Subscription warnings should use distinct visual treatment\n- \"Skip\" button needs reassurance text\n- Mobile: auth command copy must be easy\n\n## Technical Approach\n1. Add prominent AlertCard to status-check page explaining device flow\n2. Add \"Copy URL, paste in laptop browser\" instructions\n3. Enhance service cards with subscription badges\n4. Default-collapse Recommended and Optional tiers\n5. Add reassurance text near skip button\n\n## Estimated Effort\nMedium (2 wizard page updates)\n\n## Priority Justification\nP1 (High) - Without this, users cannot authenticate and cannot use the tools they just installed.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-22T13:35:19.713077-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-22T14:50:10.074975-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-22T14:50:10.074975-05:00","close_reason":"Already implemented across multiple beads: headless auth explanation in status-check (dmff), subscription badges on accounts page (2gs8), collapsible tiers with essential defaultOpen, skip button with reassurance text.

Create .github/workflows/checksum-monitor.yml\n2. Daily cron at 6am UTC + manual trigger\n3. Run security.sh --verify --json to detect changes\n4. If mismatches found, update checksums.yaml\n5.

The installer must:\n- Work when run as root (common VPS default)\n- Work when run as ubuntu with sudo\n- Be idempotent (safe to run twice)\n- Handle connection drops and resume\n- Log everything for debugging\n\n## Design Philosophy\n**Vibe Mode Default**: Passwordless sudo, agents with full permissions, minimal friction.\n**Checkpointed Phases**: Each phase writes state so reruns skip completed work.\n**Module Manifest**: Single source of truth (acfs.manifest.yaml) drives all installs.\n\n## Installer Phases\n1. Preflight + confirm OS (Ubuntu 24.04+ / 25.x)\n2. Create/normalize `ubuntu` user + sudoers\n3. Base packages (apt)\n4. Shell (zsh + oh-my-zsh + p10k + plugins)\n5. Dev toolchain (bun, uv, rust, go, tmux, rg, ast-grep)\n6. Agent stack (claude/codex/gemini CLIs + aliases)\n7. Flywheel stack (ntm, slb, ubs, cass, cm, bv, caam, mcp_agent_mail)\n8. Post-install UX (onboard + doctor + summary)\n\n## Success Criteria\n- [ ] Fresh Ubuntu 25.x VPS → working environment in \u003c 15 minutes\n- [ ] Safe to run twice without breaking anything\n- [ ] All 8 Dicklesworthstone tools installed and verified\n- [ ] `acfs doctor` shows all green\n- [ ] Logs available at /var/log/acfs/install.log\n\n## Considerations\n- Always prefer upstream installers when available\n- Verify each tool after install\n- Provide clear error messages with fix suggestions\n- Support `--dry-run` for transparency","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-19T22:21:06.097272-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-20T12:01:44.001564-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-20T12:01:44.001564-05:00","close_reason":"All 12 sub-tasks completed.

{"id":"agentic_coding_flywheel_setup-5x9","title":"Tailscale Integration (Secure VPS Access)","description":"## Purpose\n\nAdd Tailscale to ACFS so users get zero-config secure VPS access out of the box.\n\n## Why Tailscale?\n\n### Traditional VPS Access Pain Points\n- Must open SSH port (22) to public internet → attack surface\n- Firewall rules to manage → complexity\n- IP addresses to remember → friction\n- Dynamic IPs require DDNS → more complexity\n- Public IP exposure → privacy concern\n\n### Tailscale Solves All of This\n- **Private mesh network**: SSH never exposed to public internet\n- **Zero firewall config**: Tailscale handles NAT traversal\n- **MagicDNS**: Access by name (`ssh my-vps.tailnet.ts.net`)\n- **Works anywhere**: Laptop, phone, another VPS\n- **Google SSO**: One-click auth, consistent with our recommendation\n- **Free tier**: 100 devices, 3 users - plenty for individual use\n\n### Why Not Alternatives?\n- **Raw WireGuard**: Requires manual key management, no discovery\n- **ZeroTier**: Less polished UX, no Google SSO\n- **Nebula**: More complex, designed for larger deployments\n- **OpenVPN**: Heavy, complex, dated\n\nTailscale is the clear winner for our \"vibe coding\" audience.\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\n### Installation Method: APT Repository\nTailscale provides official apt repo. This is preferred over:\n- Snap (sandboxing issues)\n- Manual binary (no auto-updates)\n- Docker (overkill for system service)\n\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh\n```\n\nOr via apt directly:\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/ubuntu/jammy.noarmor.gpg | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/tailscale-archive-keyring.gpg\necho \"deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/tailscale-archive-keyring.gpg] https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/ubuntu jammy main\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tailscale.list\nsudo apt-get update \u0026\u0026 sudo apt-get install -y tailscale\n```\n\n### Post-Install Authentication\nTailscale requires interactive auth:\n```bash\nsudo tailscale up\n```\nOpens browser or prints auth URL. User logs in with Google.\n\n### SSH Configuration (Optional Enhancement)\nConfigure SSH to use Tailscale IP:\n```bash\ntailscale ip -4  # Get Tailscale IP\n# Add to ~/.ssh/config on client machine\n```\n\nOr use Tailscale SSH (beta):\n```bash\nsudo tailscale up --ssh\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. `tailscale` module in acfs.manifest.yaml\n2. Tailscale installed via apt repo method\n3. Post-install message guides user to run `tailscale up`\n4. `acfs doctor` checks Tailscale status\n5. Works on Ubuntu 22.04, 24.04, 25.x\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n- Tailscale daemon runs as root (required for networking)\n- Auth tokens stored in /var/lib/tailscale/\n- Tailscale's security model is well-audited\n- User should enable 2FA on Tailscale account","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-21T16:57:22.188553-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-21T17:44:39.368528-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-21T17:44:39.368528-05:00","close_reason":"All acceptance criteria met: 1) Tailscale module in manifest (lines 151-187), 2) APT install via tailscale.sh, 3) Post-install summary shows auth guidance, 4) doctor.sh checks status (lines 780-796), 5) Ubuntu 22/24/25 supported via codename handling"}

Remove SSH key instructions; emphasize noting the password.\n\n## Current State\n\nThe page currently has a checklist including:\n- \"Pasted my SSH public key\"\n- Provider-specific SSH key instructions\n\nThis causes the critical \"where do I paste my key?\" confusion.\n\n## Target State\n\nSimplified checklist:\n- [ ] Selected Ubuntu 24.04+ or 25.10\n- [ ] Chose a region close to me  \n- [ ] Set/noted my root password\n- [ ] Completed order and got IP address\n\nNo SSH key paste required.\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### File: apps/web/app/wizard/create-vps/page.tsx\n\n### Changes Required\n\n1. **Remove SSH key checklist item**\n   - Delete or comment out the SSH key paste requirement\n   \n2. **Add password emphasis**\n   - New checklist item: \"Set a root password (write it down!)\"\n   - Add warning: \"You'll need this password for first connection\"\n\n3. **Update provider-specific guidance**\n   - Contabo: \"Skip the SSH key section - we'll set that up later\"\n   - OVH: \"Choose 'Password' for authentication method\"\n\n4. **Simplify SimplerGuide content**\n   - Remove detailed SSH key pasting instructions\n   - Add \"Why password first?\" explanation\n\n### New Content\n\n\\`\\`\\`typescript\nconst CHECKLIST = [\n  { label: \"Ubuntu 24.04+ selected\", key: \"ubuntu\" },\n  { label: \"Region chosen\", key: \"region\" },\n  { label: \"Root password set and saved\", key: \"password\" },\n  { label: \"Order completed, IP address noted\", key: \"complete\" },\n];\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n### SimplerGuide Update\n\nAdd explanation:\n\u003e **Why password first?**\n\u003e \n\u003e Setting up SSH keys through the VPS provider's website is confusing and\n\u003e error-prone. Instead, we'll connect with a password first, then the\n\u003e installer will help you set up your SSH key properly. Much easier!\n\n### Provider Notes\n\nAdd clear guidance:\n\u003e **Contabo users**: When you see \"Password \u0026 Login\", choose \"Password\".\n\u003e Skip any SSH key sections - we'll set that up in the next steps.\n\u003e\n\u003e **OVH users**: Select \"Password\" for authentication. You can add SSH\n\u003e keys later through our installer.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] SSH key paste instruction removed from checklist\n- [ ] Password emphasis added to checklist\n- [ ] Clear guidance to skip SSH key in provider UI\n- [ ] SimplerGuide explains password-first approach\n- [ ] Provider-specific instructions updated\n- [ ] No broken references to removed content\n\n## Testing\n\n1. Read through page as complete beginner\n2. Verify no mention of pasting SSH key into provider\n3. Verify password setup is emphasized\n4.

More complete term coverage\n2. Beginner-friendly definitions (not Wikipedia-style)\n3. Consistent usage throughout wizard\n4. Possibly a dedicated Glossary page for reference\n\nThis is a \"polish\" epic that improves the entire experience incrementally rather than fixing a specific step.\n\n## User Story\nAs a beginner encountering technical terms,\nI want to quickly understand what they mean,\nSo that I can follow the instructions without getting lost in jargon.\n\n## Success Criteria\n1.

The concern was that lesson content might not accurately reflect the actual CLI syntax and behavior of the tools.\n\nMETHODOLOGY:\n1. Cloned all 7 Dicklesworthstone tools to /tmp/dicklesworthstone_tools/:\n   - cass (coding_agent_session_search)\n   - cm (cass_memory_system)\n   - bv (beads_viewer)\n   - ubs (ultimate_bug_scanner)\n   - agent_mail (mcp_agent_mail)\n   - slb (simultaneous_launch_button)\n   - caam (coding_agent_account_manager)\n\n2. Read comprehensive READMEs (some 1000+ lines) for each tool\n3. Compared lesson file content against actual tool documentation\n4.

Run full installation and verify progress updates\n2. Test with slow network (progress should still work)\n3. Test with failed module (guidance should appear)\n4. Test in different terminals (iTerm, Terminal.app, Windows Terminal)\n5.

{"id":"agentic_coding_flywheel_setup-bq3","title":"Ubuntu Auto-Upgrade Feature","description":"# Ubuntu Auto-Upgrade Feature\n\n## Overview\nAutomatically detect Ubuntu version and upgrade to the latest stable release (25.10) before running the main ACFS installation. The entire process should be **fully automated and non-interactive**.\n\n## Problem Statement\nMany cloud providers (OVH, Contabo, Hetzner) default to older Ubuntu versions (22.04, 24.04). ACFS works best on the latest Ubuntu, and some packages may not be available on older versions. Currently, ACFS just warns about old versions but doesn't help upgrade.\n\n## Solution\nAdd a pre-installation phase that:\n1. Detects current Ubuntu version\n2. Calculates upgrade path to target version\n3. Automatically performs sequential do-release-upgrade operations\n4. Handles reboots with automatic resume via systemd service\n5. Continues ACFS installation after reaching target version\n\n## Design Philosophy\n- **Fully automated**: No user interaction required once started\n- **Resilient**: Handle reboots, network issues, and failures gracefully\n- **Observable**: Comprehensive logging for debugging\n- **Opt-out available**: Users can skip with --skip-ubuntu-upgrade\n\n## Default Behavior\nWith the standard one-liner:\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL .../install.sh | bash -s -- --yes --mode vibe\n```\nThe installer will:\n1. Detect Ubuntu version\n2. If below 25.10, automatically upgrade (no prompts)\n3. Reboot as needed\n4. Resume and continue upgrading until at target\n5. Proceed with ACFS installation\n\n## Opt-out\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL .../install.sh | bash -s -- --yes --mode vibe --skip-ubuntu-upgrade\n```\n\n## Technical Constraints\n1. Ubuntu only allows upgrading to NEXT version (no skipping)\n   - 22.04 → 24.04 (LTS-to-LTS is special case)\n   - 24.04 → 24.10 → 25.04 → 25.10 (sequential)\n2. Each upgrade requires a reboot\n3. do-release-upgrade takes 30-60 minutes per version\n4. SSH sessions will disconnect during reboot (users must reconnect)\n5. Need systemd service for automatic resume after reboot\n\n## Success Criteria\n- [ ] Detects Ubuntu version accurately\n- [ ] Calculates correct upgrade path\n- [ ] Performs upgrade non-interactively\n- [ ] Creates systemd service for post-reboot resume\n- [ ] Chains multiple upgrades without manual intervention\n- [ ] Resumes ACFS installation after final upgrade\n- [ ] Cleans up systemd service after completion\n- [ ] Handles errors with clear logging\n- [ ] Works across SSH disconnection/reconnection","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-21T16:18:52.892435-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-21T17:17:59.471452-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-21T17:17:59.471452-05:00","close_reason":"All sub-tasks complete: ubu.1-ubu.12 implemented the upgrade system, ubu.8 (d7c) documented it.

{"id":"agentic_coding_flywheel_setup-cfk","title":"Write security best practices documentation page","description":"## Task\n\nCreate a documentation page explaining our security recommendations and the Google SSO strategy.\n\n## Location\n\n`apps/web/app/docs/security/page.tsx` or `apps/web/content/security.mdx`\n\n## Content Outline\n\n### 1. Introduction\n- Why security matters for vibe coding\n- The \"one account to rule them all\" philosophy\n- This guide's scope (account security, not VPS hardening)\n\n### 2. The Google SSO Strategy\n\n#### Why We Recommend It\n- Single identity across services\n- Fewer passwords = fewer weak points\n- Google's security infrastructure protects everything\n- Easy recovery through Google\n\n#### How It Works\n```\nYour Google Account\n    ├── Tailscale (VPS access)\n    ├── Claude.ai (coding agent)\n    ├── ChatGPT/Codex (coding agent)\n    ├── Gemini (coding agent - native)\n    ├── Vercel (deployment)\n    └── Supabase (database)\n```\n\n#### The Trade-Off\n- Single point of failure: if Google compromised, everything is\n- Mitigated by: making Google account extremely secure\n\n### 3. Securing Your Google Account\n\n#### Essential Steps (Do These Now)\n1. **Enable 2-Step Verification**\n   - Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/signinoptions/two-step-verification\n   - Use authenticator app, not SMS\n   \n2. **Review Recovery Options**\n   - Recovery email: set a secondary email\n   - Recovery phone: set if comfortable\n   \n3. **Check Connected Apps**\n   - Review: https://myaccount.google.com/permissions\n   - Remove any you don't recognize\n\n#### Advanced Steps (Highly Recommended)\n1. **Use a Strong, Unique Password**\n   - Generated by password manager\n   - Never used elsewhere\n   \n2. **Enable Advanced Protection Program**\n   - For high-risk users (developers count!)\n   - https://landing.google.com/advancedprotection/\n   - Requires security keys\n\n3. **Use Security Keys**\n   - Hardware keys (YubiKey, Google Titan)\n   - Strongest form of 2FA\n   - Required for Advanced Protection\n\n### 4. Services Without Google SSO\n\nSome services don't support Google SSO:\n- **GitHub**: Email + password (use strong, unique password)\n- **Cloudflare**: Email + password\n\nFor these:\n- Use your primary Google email address\n- Generate strong password with password manager\n- Enable their native 2FA\n\n### 5. Password Manager Recommendation\n\nIf not already using one:\n- **1Password**: Best overall\n- **Bitwarden**: Best free option\n- **Apple Keychain**: Good if Apple ecosystem\n\nUse it for:\n- GitHub password\n- Cloudflare password\n- Any service without Google SSO\n\n### 6. Quick Security Checklist\n\n```\n[ ] Google 2-Step Verification enabled\n[ ] Google recovery options set\n[ ] Using authenticator app (not SMS)\n[ ] GitHub 2FA enabled\n[ ] Strong, unique passwords for non-SSO services\n[ ] Using a password manager\n```\n\n### 7. What If Google Gets Compromised?\n\nSteps to take immediately:\n1. Change Google password from a trusted device\n2. Revoke all connected app permissions\n3. Check for unauthorized logins\n4. Re-authenticate all SSO services\n5. Enable Advanced Protection Program\n\n## Design Notes\n\n- Use callout boxes for important warnings\n- Include screenshots for Google settings\n- Make checklist interactive (can check off items)\n- Mobile-friendly layout","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"PinkCastle","created_at":"2025-12-21T17:01:16.35343-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-21T17:36:17.010786-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-21T17:36:17.010786-05:00","close_reason":"Enhanced security docs with password manager recommendations and account recovery steps","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"agentic_coding_flywheel_setup-cfk","depends_on_id":"agentic_coding_flywheel_setup-4ey","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-21T17:03:25.269753-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

{"id":"agentic_coding_flywheel_setup-cxr","title":"[ubu.11] Implement error recovery and graceful degradation","description":"# Implement Error Recovery and Graceful Degradation\n\n## Purpose\nHandle upgrade failures gracefully and provide recovery paths. This is CRITICAL - a failed upgrade can leave the system in an unusable state.\n\n## Failure Modes and Recovery\n\n### 1. Network Failure During Package Download\n**Detection**: apt-get returns error 100 or timeout\n**Recovery**:\n```bash\nubuntu_retry_with_backoff() {\n  local cmd=\"$1\"\n  local max_retries=5\n  local delay=30\n  \n  for i in $(seq 1 $max_retries); do\n    if eval \"$cmd\"; then\n      return 0\n    fi\n    \n    log_warn \"Attempt $i failed, retrying in ${delay}s...\"\n    sleep $delay\n    delay=$((delay * 2))  # Exponential backoff\n  done\n  \n  return 1\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Disk Full During Upgrade\n**Detection**: apt-get returns ENOSPC error\n**Recovery**:\n```bash\nubuntu_emergency_cleanup() {\n  log_warn \"Attempting emergency disk cleanup...\"\n  \n  # Clear apt cache\n  apt-get clean\n  \n  # Remove old kernels (keep current + previous)\n  apt-get autoremove -y\n  \n  # Clear journal logs over 100MB\n  journalctl --vacuum-size=100M\n  \n  # Report remaining space\n  df -h / | tail -1\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Interrupted dpkg\n**Detection**: `/var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend` exists, dpkg --configure fails\n**Recovery**:\n```bash\nubuntu_fix_dpkg() {\n  log_warn \"Fixing interrupted dpkg...\"\n  \n  # Wait for any running apt\n  while fuser /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend \u003e/dev/null 2\u003e\u00261; do\n    sleep 5\n  done\n  \n  # Configure any unpacked packages\n  dpkg --configure -a\n  \n  # Fix broken dependencies\n  apt-get -f install -y\n}\n```\n\n### 4. do-release-upgrade Failure\n**Detection**: do-release-upgrade returns non-zero\n**Recovery**:\n```bash\nubuntu_recover_upgrade() {\n  local error_code=\"$1\"\n  \n  case \"$error_code\" in\n    1)\n      # General failure - try fixing deps\n      apt-get -f install -y\n      apt-get dist-upgrade -y\n      ;;\n    *)\n      log_error \"do-release-upgrade failed with code $error_code\"\n      log_info \"Manual intervention may be required\"\n      ;;\n  esac\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Reboot Fails / System Does Not Come Back\n\n**Detection**: Cannot detect from same system\n**Mitigation**:\n- State file preserves progress\n- User can SSH back and check status\n- Resume service will restart upgrade\n\n**User Recovery**:\n```\nIf system fails to boot:\n1. Boot from recovery mode (hold SHIFT during boot)\n2. Select \"root shell\"\n3. Run: dpkg --configure -a \u0026\u0026 apt-get -f install\n4. Reboot normally\n```\n\n## Graceful Degradation\n\nIf upgrade cannot proceed, allow ACFS to continue on current version:\n\n```bash\nubuntu_upgrade_with_fallback() {\n  if \\! ubuntu_do_upgrade; then\n    log_error \"Ubuntu upgrade failed\"\n    \n    # Check if system is still functional\n    if apt-get update \u0026\u003e/dev/null; then\n      log_warn \"System is functional. Continuing ACFS on current Ubuntu version.\"\n      log_warn \"Some features may not work optimally.\"\n      \n      # Mark upgrade as skipped, not failed\n      state_upgrade_skip \"upgrade_failed_graceful_degradation\"\n      \n      # Continue with ACFS installation\n      return 0\n    else\n      log_error \"System may be in inconsistent state. Manual recovery needed.\"\n      return 1\n    fi\n  fi\n}\n```\n\n## Error Logging\n\nAll errors should be logged with context:\n```bash\nubuntu_log_error() {\n  local component=\"$1\"\n  local message=\"$2\"\n  local timestamp=$(date -Iseconds)\n  \n  echo \"[$timestamp] ERROR [$component] $message\" \u003e\u003e /var/log/acfs/upgrade.log\n  \n  # Also save to state for resume debugging\n  state_upgrade_set_error \"$component: $message\"\n}\n```\n\n## Post-Failure Diagnostics\n\nCreate diagnostic dump on failure:\n```bash\nubuntu_create_diagnostic_dump() {\n  local dump_file=\"/var/log/acfs/upgrade_diagnostic_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).txt\"\n  \n  {\n    echo \"=== ACFS Upgrade Diagnostic Dump ===\"\n    echo \"Timestamp: $(date)\"\n    echo \"\"\n    echo \"=== Ubuntu Version ===\"\n    cat /etc/os-release\n    echo \"\"\n    echo \"=== Disk Space ===\"\n    df -h\n    echo \"\"\n    echo \"=== Memory ===\"\n    free -h\n    echo \"\"\n    echo \"=== dpkg Status ===\"\n    dpkg --audit\n    echo \"\"\n    echo \"=== APT History (last 50 lines) ===\"\n    tail -50 /var/log/apt/history.log\n    echo \"\"\n    echo \"=== ACFS State ===\"\n    cat /var/lib/acfs/upgrade_state.json 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"No state file\"\n    echo \"\"\n    echo \"=== Last 100 lines of upgrade log ===\"\n    tail -100 /var/log/acfs/upgrade.log 2\u003e/dev/null || echo \"No upgrade log\"\n  } \u003e \"$dump_file\"\n  \n  log_info \"Diagnostic dump saved to: $dump_file\"\n}\n```\n\n## Priority: P1 (Critical)\n\nThis task is P1 because error handling is what separates a robust tool from a fragile script.

{"id":"agentic_coding_flywheel_setup-d0g","title":"Implement Dicklesworthstone stack updates (checksum-aware)","description":"## What\nImplement the 'stack' category for acfs-update with SECURE checksum verification.\n\nTools to update:\n- NTM (Named Tmux Manager)\n- MCP Agent Mail\n- UBS (Ultimate Bug Scanner)\n- BV (Beads Viewer)\n- CASS (Coding Agent Session Search)\n- CM (CASS Memory System)\n- CAAM (Coding Agent Account Manager)\n- SLB (Simultaneous Launch Button)\n- BD (Beads CLI) - the task tracker itself\n\n## SECURITY: Checksum-Aware Update Flow\nUnlike the \"bypass checksums\" approach, we MUST verify checksums to prevent executing compromised scripts:\n\n1. Check if tool is installed (binary exists)\n2. If not installed: skip (acfs-update doesn't install new tools)\n3. If installed:\n   a. Fetch installer script from GitHub\n   b. Calculate SHA256 checksum\n   c. Compare to checksums.yaml:\n      - MATCH: Run installer safely (known-good script)\n      - MISMATCH: Script changed upstream. Options:\n        * Show warning with URL to review changes\n        * If --yes: proceed (user accepts risk)\n        * If interactive: prompt [S]kip / [P]roceed / [V]iew diff\n        * Default: Skip and continue with other tools\n\n## Why This Matters\nBypassing checksums would allow an attacker who compromises a GitHub repo to execute arbitrary code on all users who run `acfs-update`. The tradeoff of prompting on upstream changes is worth the security.\n\n## Special Cases\n- MCP Agent Mail: git pull + uv sync in ~/mcp_agent_mail (no installer re-run)\n- BD (Beads): Check where installed, use appropriate update method\n\n## Success Criteria\n- [ ] All 9 stack tools update correctly\n- [ ] Checksum verification works\n- [ ] User prompted on checksum mismatch (unless --yes)\n- [ ] MCP Agent Mail git+uv flow works\n- [ ] Skips uninstalled tools\n- [ ] Version changes logged","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-21T13:32:07.801083-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-21T15:13:32.430411-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-21T15:13:32.430411-05:00","close_reason":"Already implemented in scripts/lib/update.sh:update_stack() with checksum verification via update_run_verified_installer for all 8 stack tools","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"agentic_coding_flywheel_setup-d0g","depends_on_id":"agentic_coding_flywheel_setup-75e","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-21T13:32:19.582864-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

Progress Bar \u0026 Statistics\n```\n╭─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮\n│  ACFS Onboarding                                            │\n│  ████████████████░░░░░░░░ 7/9 lessons (78%)                │\n│  Est. time remaining: ~15 minutes                           │\n╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯\n\n  [1] ✓ Welcome \u0026 Mental Model          [done]\n  [2] ✓ Linux Navigation Basics         [done]  \n  [3] ✓ SSH \u0026 Persistence               [done]\n  [4] ✓ tmux Basics                     [done]\n  [5] ✓ Agent Commands                  [done]\n  [6] ✓ NTM Command Center              [done]\n  [7] ✓ NTM Prompt Palette              [done]\n  [8] → Flywheel Loop                   [next]\n  [9]   Keeping Updated                 [ ]\n```\n\n### 2. \"Try It\" Sections in Lessons\nAdd interactive prompts in markdown that the TUI recognizes:\n\n```markdown\n## Try It Yourself\n\nRun this command to see your tmux sessions:\n\n\\`\\`\\`try\nntm list\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n**Expected output:**\n\\`\\`\\`expected\nNo active sessions. Use 'ntm new \u003cname\u003e' to create one.\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nDid it work? Press [y] to continue or [n] for troubleshooting.\n```\n\nThe TUI parses these blocks and:\n- Highlights the command to try\n- Shows expected output for comparison\n- Offers troubleshooting if output differs\n\n### 3. Cheatsheet Integration\nAdd to lesson content:\n```markdown\n\u003e 💡 **Quick Reference**: Run `acfs cheatsheet git` to see all git aliases\n```\n\nAnd add `onboard --cheatsheet` subcommand that invokes the cheatsheet.\n\n### 4.

We show expected output but don't run commands for users because:\n1. They need to learn the muscle memory\n2. Commands might have side effects\n3. Environment might differ from expected\n\n### Keeping Lessons Light\nAvoid making lessons feel like tests. The \"Try It\" sections are optional prompts, not gates. Users can skip if they want.\n\n### Gum Dependency\nProgress bars need gum.

{"id":"agentic_coding_flywheel_setup-fslp","title":"FEATURE: Installer SSH Key Integration","description":"## Parent Epic\nagentic_coding_flywheel_setup-umqa (Beginner UX Overhaul v1.0)\n\n## Summary\n\nAdd interactive SSH public key prompting to the ACFS installer. When users connect with password,\nthe installer will prompt them to paste their public key, validate it, install it properly, and\nenable key-based authentication for both root and ubuntu users.\n\n## Background \u0026 Motivation\n\nCurrently, users are expected to paste their SSH public key into the VPS provider's web UI during\nserver creation. This is problematic because:\n\n1. Each provider has different UI for SSH key management\n2. Users often can't find where to paste the key\n3. Providers may require keys during creation OR after, inconsistently\n4. If done wrong, users get \"Permission denied\" with no helpful guidance\n\nBy moving SSH key installation INTO the installer, we:\n- Control the entire user experience\n- Provide clear prompts and validation\n- Can verify the key works before proceeding\n- Support any VPS provider universally\n\n## Technical Design\n\n### New Function: `prompt_ssh_key()`\n\nLocation: `scripts/lib/user.sh` (alongside existing user functions)\n\n```bash\nprompt_ssh_key() {\n    # Skip if already have a valid key\n    if [[ -f /root/.ssh/authorized_keys ]] \u0026\u0026 grep -q \"^ssh-\" /root/.ssh/authorized_keys; then\n        log_detail \"SSH key already present in root authorized_keys\"\n        return 0\n    fi\n\n    echo \"\"\n    echo \"╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗\"\n    echo \"║  SSH Key Setup                                               ║\"\n    echo \"╠══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣\"\n    echo \"║  You connected with a password. Let's set up SSH key auth   ║\"\n    echo \"║  so you won't need the password anymore.                    ║\"\n    echo \"╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝\"\n    echo \"\"\n    echo \"Paste your PUBLIC key below.

You'll need password for future connections.\"\n        return 0\n    fi\n\n    # Validate key format\n    if [[ ! \"$pubkey\" =~ ^ssh-(ed25519|rsa|ecdsa) ]]; then\n        log_error \"Invalid key format. Expected: ssh-ed25519 or ssh-rsa...\"\n        log_detail \"Make sure you're pasting the PUBLIC key (.pub file)\"\n        return 1\n    fi\n\n    # Install key for root\n    mkdir -p /root/.ssh\n    echo \"$pubkey\" \u003e\u003e /root/.ssh/authorized_keys\n    chmod 700 /root/.ssh\n    chmod 600 /root/.ssh/authorized_keys\n    \n    log_success \"SSH key installed for root user\"\n    \n    # The existing migrate_ssh_keys() in normalize_user() will copy to ubuntu\n    return 0\n}\n```\n\n### Integration Point\n\nCall `prompt_ssh_key()` at the START of the installer, BEFORE `normalize_user()`:\n\n```bash\n# In install.sh main flow\nif [[ $EUID -eq 0 ]]; then\n    prompt_ssh_key  # New: prompt for key if needed\nfi\nsource_lib \"user.sh\"\nnormalize_user  # Existing: includes migrate_ssh_keys()\n```\n\n### Validation \u0026 Testing\n\n1. **Key format validation**: Must start with `ssh-ed25519`, `ssh-rsa`, or `ssh-ecdsa`\n2. **Idempotency**: If key already exists, skip prompting\n3. **Skip option**: User can press Enter to skip (uses password)\n4. **Migration works**: Verify migrate_ssh_keys() copies to ubuntu\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Installer prompts for SSH key when running as root with no existing key\n- [ ] Valid key is installed to /root/.ssh/authorized_keys\n- [ ] Invalid key format shows helpful error message\n- [ ] User can skip by pressing Enter\n- [ ] Key is migrated to ubuntu user by existing migrate_ssh_keys()\n- [ ] Subsequent installer runs don't re-prompt (idempotent)\n- [ ] Works when piped from curl (stdin handling)\n\n## Edge Cases\n\n1. **Key already exists**: Skip prompt, log that key was found\n2. **Invalid key format**: Show error, offer retry\n3. **Empty input**: Skip setup, warn about password requirement\n4. **Stdin is not a terminal**: Non-interactive mode, skip prompt with warning\n5. **Permission issues**: Handle read-only filesystem gracefully\n\n## Testing Plan\n\n1. Fresh VPS with password-only access → should prompt\n2. VPS with existing SSH key → should skip\n3. Run installer twice → should not re-prompt\n4. Paste invalid key → should show helpful error\n5. Test on Ubuntu 24.04 and 25.10\n\n## Dependencies\n\nNone - this is the foundational change that enables password-first flow.\n\n## Blocks\n\n- Wizard page updates (need installer changes first)\n- Post-installation key verification step","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-21T19:15:16.377793-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-21T19:29:55.81164-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-21T19:29:55.81164-05:00","close_reason":"Feature specification is complete.

Don't read zshrc (most users)\n2. Forget aliases they don't use daily\n3. Reinvent the wheel with longer commands\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\n### 1. Cheatsheet Command\n```bash\n$ acfs cheatsheet\n# or\n$ onboard --cheatsheet\n\n╭─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮\n│  ACFS Command Cheatsheet                                    │\n╰─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯\n\nAI Agents\n  cc              Claude Code (with permissions bypass)\n  cod             Codex CLI (sandbox bypass)\n  gmi             Gemini CLI (yolo mode)\n  am              Start MCP Agent Mail server\n\nGit Shortcuts\n  gs              git status\n  gd              git diff\n  gp              git push\n  gpu             git pull\n  gco \u003cbranch\u003e    git checkout\n  gcm \"msg\"       git commit -m\n  glog            Pretty git log graph\n\nModern CLI\n  ls              → lsd (with icons)\n  cat             → bat (syntax highlight)\n  find            → fd (faster)\n  grep            → rg (ripgrep)\n  top             → btop (beautiful)\n\nSession Management\n  ntm new \u003cname\u003e  Create tmux session\n  ntm attach \u003cn\u003e  Resume session\n  ntm list        Show all sessions\n  Ctrl+B, D       Detach from session\n\nDirectories\n  p               → /data/projects\n  proj            → ~/Projects\n  dev             → ~/Development\n\nSearch 'pattern' to filter: acfs cheatsheet git\n```\n\n### 2. Enhanced `acfs help`\nCurrently shows subcommands. Enhance to include:\n```bash\n$ acfs help --commands   # Alias for cheatsheet\n$ acfs help --aliases    # Just the alias mappings\n```\n\n### 3. Integration Points\n- Include condensed version in `acfs info` output\n- Add \"Quick Commands\" section to onboard lessons\n- Make cheatsheet searchable/filterable\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\n### Extraction, Not Duplication\n**CRITICAL**: Do NOT hardcode alias list in the cheatsheet script!\n\nInstead:\n1. Parse `~/.acfs/zsh/acfs.zshrc` programmatically\n2. Extract alias definitions with regex\n3. Categorize based on comments/patterns\n4. Generate cheatsheet dynamically\n\nThis ensures:\n- Single source of truth (zshrc)\n- Cheatsheet auto-updates when aliases change\n- No sync issues between files\n\n### Category Detection\nUse comments in zshrc as section markers:\n```bash\n# === Git Aliases ===\nalias gs='git status'\n...\n```\n\nOr detect by pattern:\n- Starts with 'g' + git command → Git category\n- Starts with 'd' + docker command → Docker category\n- Known tools (cc, cod, gmi) → Agents category\n\n## File Locations\n- Implementation: `scripts/lib/cheatsheet.sh` (new)\n- Integration: Update `acfs.zshrc` acfs() function\n- Also expose via: `onboard --cheatsheet`\n\n## Output Formats\n- Terminal (default): Colorful, categorized\n- `--json`: Machine-readable\n- `--category git`: Filter to one category\n- `--search pattern`: Filter by name/description\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] `acfs cheatsheet` shows all aliases categorized\n- [ ] Aliases extracted dynamically from zshrc (not hardcoded)\n- [ ] Searchable/filterable output\n- [ ] Categories: Agents, Git, Docker, CLI, Directories, Bun, Session\n- [ ] Condensed version appears in `acfs info` output\n- [ ] Works offline\n- [ ] Gum-enhanced UI with fallback\n\n## Design Considerations\n\n### Why Dynamic Extraction?\nIf we hardcode the cheatsheet, it WILL drift from actual aliases. Dynamic extraction ensures accuracy.\n\n### Why Not Just 'alias' Command?\nThe built-in `alias` command dumps everything unsorted. Users need:\n- Categorization\n- Descriptions (what does 'glog' actually do?)\n- Visual hierarchy\n- Filtering\n\n### Integration with Onboard\nConsider adding to lesson 04_agents_login.md or creating a new \"Command Reference\" lesson that pulls from this system.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-22T14:52:59.619549-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-22T15:20:18.633152-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-22T15:20:18.633152-05:00","close_reason":"Cheatsheet system complete: acfs cheatsheet command with dynamic zshrc parsing, category/search filtering, JSON output, gum UI with fallback","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"agentic_coding_flywheel_setup-gy0i","depends_on_id":"agentic_coding_flywheel_setup-9y9x","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-22T14:53:13.629886-05:00","created_by":"jemanuel"}]}

We need the key installed FIRST.\n\n2. **After sourcing libs**: We need the logging functions and prompt_ssh_key available.\n\n3. **Root check**: Only prompt if running as root (the password-first flow).\n\n### Error Handling\n\nThe \\`|| true\\` ensures the installer continues even if:\n- User skips the key setup\n- Key validation fails\n- Any other issue with the prompt\n\nUsers can always add their key later manually.\n\n### Testing\n\n1. Run full installer as root without existing key → should see prompt\n2. Run full installer with existing key → should skip\n3. After installer, verify ubuntu user has the key:\n   \\`cat /home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys\\`\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] SSH key prompt appears early in installation\n- [ ] Prompt happens BEFORE normalize_user\n- [ ] Key is migrated to ubuntu user after prompt\n- [ ] Installer continues if user skips\n- [ ] Installer continues if key validation fails\n- [ ] No changes to existing flow for users with keys\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- TASK: Implement prompt_ssh_key() function (must exist first)\n\n## Files Modified\n\n- install.sh (add call to prompt_ssh_key)","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-21T19:19:27.679097-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-21T19:33:33.337938-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-21T19:33:33.337938-05:00","close_reason":"Already implemented: prompt_ssh_key call present in install.sh normalize_user flow","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"agentic_coding_flywheel_setup-hy7z","depends_on_id":"agentic_coding_flywheel_setup-6y4w","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-21T19:19:53.184827-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

Users who read lessons or README before/during setup\nwould get conflicting information.\n\nThis feature ensures documentation consistency across all touchpoints.\n\n## Scope\n\n### 1. Learning Hub Lessons\n\nUpdate the 9 lessons in /content/lessons/:\n\n| Lesson | Changes Needed |\n|--------|---------------|\n| 00_welcome.md | Update overview of setup process |\n| 01_linux_basics.md | No changes needed |\n| 02_ssh_basics.md | Update SSH key flow explanation |\n| 03_tmux_basics.md | No changes needed |\n| 04_agents_login.md | Update auth instructions |\n| 05_ntm_core.md | No changes needed |\n| 06_ntm_command_palette.md | No changes needed |\n| 07_flywheel_loop.md | No changes needed |\n| 08_keeping_updated.md | No changes needed |\n\nKey updates:\n- Lesson 2 (SSH Basics): Explain password-first approach\n- Lesson 4 (Agent Commands): Update auth expectations\n\n### 2. README.md Updates\n\nCurrent README mentions SSH setup - update to reflect:\n- Password-first approach\n- Simplified wizard flow\n- \"Your First 5 Minutes\" after install\n\n### 3. \"Practice Now\" Sections\n\nAdd to each lesson a practical exercise that users can do on their VPS:\n\n\\`\\`\\`markdown\n## Practice This Now\n\nSSH into your VPS and try these commands:\n1. \\`ls -la ~/\\` - List your home directory\n2. \\`pwd\\` - Show current directory\n3. \\`cd /tmp \u0026\u0026 pwd\\` - Navigate to tmp\n\nWhen you've tried these, come back and click \"Mark Complete\".\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nThis bridges the gap between web-based learning and terminal practice.\n\n### 4. Quick Reference Updates\n\nUpdate the reference pages:\n- /learn/commands - Ensure SSH commands reflect new flow\n- /learn/glossary - Add any new terms\n\n### 5. Inline Documentation\n\nUpdate code comments in:\n- install.sh - Explain SSH key prompt\n- scripts/lib/user.sh - Document key migration flow\n- Wizard page components - Update JSDoc comments\n\n## Content Guidelines\n\n### Tone for Beginners\n- Assume zero prior knowledge\n- Explain \"why\" not just \"what\"\n- Use analogies (SSH key = house key + lock)\n- Acknowledge when something is scary/confusing\n\n### Command Examples\n- Always show expected output\n- Include copy buttons\n- Add troubleshooting for common errors\n\n### Visual Consistency\n- Use same component library (CommandCard, AlertCard)\n- Consistent color coding\n- Mobile-friendly layouts\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] All lessons accurate for new flow\n- [ ] README reflects password-first approach\n- [ ] Practice sections in relevant lessons\n- [ ] Quick reference pages updated\n- [ ] No conflicting information across docs\n- [ ] All code comments updated\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- ALL other features in this epic\n- This should be done LAST to ensure accuracy\n\n## Testing Plan\n\n1.

{"id":"agentic_coding_flywheel_setup-lhe","title":"[ubu.10] Add user communication and progress tracking","description":"# Add User Communication and Progress Tracking\n\n## Purpose\nProvide visibility to users during the multi-reboot upgrade process, especially when they SSH back in.\n\n## Problem\nWhen a user SSH reconnects during/after an upgrade:\n1. They have no idea what state the system is in\n2. They might run install.sh again (could conflict)\n3. They might try to use apt (could fail during upgrade)\n\n## Solutions\n\n### 1. MOTD (Message of the Day) Update\n\nCreate temporary MOTD during upgrade:\n```bash\nubuntu_set_upgrade_motd() {\n  cat \u003e /etc/motd.d/99-acfs-upgrade \u003c\u003cEOF\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n  ACFS Ubuntu Upgrade in Progress\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\n  Original version: $ORIGINAL_VERSION\n  Target version:   $TARGET_VERSION\n  Current step:     $CURRENT_STEP\n  \n  Progress: $COMPLETED_HOPS / $TOTAL_HOPS upgrades complete\n  \n  To check status:  cat /var/lib/acfs/upgrade_state.json | jq .\n  To view logs:     tail -f /var/log/acfs/upgrade.log\n  \n  DO NOT run apt or install.sh while upgrade is in progress.\n  \n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\nEOF\n}\n\nubuntu_clear_upgrade_motd() {\n  rm -f /etc/motd.d/99-acfs-upgrade\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Lock File to Prevent Concurrent Runs\n\nPrevent install.sh from running during upgrade:\n```bash\nACFS_UPGRADE_LOCK=\"/var/run/acfs-upgrade.lock\"\n\nubuntu_acquire_lock() {\n  if [[ -f \"$ACFS_UPGRADE_LOCK\" ]]; then\n    local pid=$(cat \"$ACFS_UPGRADE_LOCK\")\n    if kill -0 \"$pid\" 2\u003e/dev/null; then\n      log_error \"Another upgrade is in progress (PID: $pid)\"\n      return 1\n    fi\n    # Stale lock file\n    rm -f \"$ACFS_UPGRADE_LOCK\"\n  fi\n  echo $$ \u003e \"$ACFS_UPGRADE_LOCK\"\n}\n\nubuntu_release_lock() {\n  rm -f \"$ACFS_UPGRADE_LOCK\"\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Status Check Command\n\nCreate simple status script:\n```bash\n# /var/lib/acfs/check_upgrade_status.sh\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\nif [[ -f /var/lib/acfs/upgrade_state.json ]]; then\n  echo \"ACFS Ubuntu Upgrade Status\"\n  echo \"==========================\"\n  cat /var/lib/acfs/upgrade_state.json | jq -r \"\n    \\\"Original: \\\" + .ubuntu_upgrade.original_version,\n    \\\"Target: \\\" + .ubuntu_upgrade.target_version,\n    \\\"Current: \\\" + ((.ubuntu_upgrade.completed_upgrades | length | tostring) + \\\"/\\\" + (.ubuntu_upgrade.upgrade_path | length | tostring)),\n    \\\"Stage: \\\" + .ubuntu_upgrade.current_stage\n  \"\nelse\n  echo \"No upgrade in progress\"\nfi\n```\n\n### 4. Pre-Reboot Warning\n\nGive users time to read before reboot:\n```bash\nubuntu_warn_reboot() {\n  log_warn \"╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗\"\n  log_warn \"║  System will reboot in 30 seconds for Ubuntu upgrade     ║\"\n  log_warn \"║                                                          ║\"\n  log_warn \"║  Your SSH session will disconnect.                       ║\"\n  log_warn \"║  Wait 2-3 minutes, then reconnect.                       ║\"\n  log_warn \"║  The upgrade will continue automatically.                ║\"\n  log_warn \"╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝\"\n  \n  for i in {30..1}; do\n    echo -ne \"\\rRebooting in $i seconds... \"\n    sleep 1\n  done\n  echo \"\"\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Progress Estimation\n\nShow time estimates:\n```bash\nubuntu_show_progress() {\n  local current_hop=\"$1\"\n  local total_hops=\"$2\"\n  local minutes_per_hop=45\n  \n  local remaining_hops=$((total_hops - current_hop + 1))\n  local remaining_minutes=$((remaining_hops * minutes_per_hop))\n  \n  log_info \"Progress: Upgrade $current_hop of $total_hops\"\n  log_info \"Estimated time remaining: ~${remaining_minutes} minutes\"\n}\n```\n\n## Integration Points\n\n1. Set MOTD at start of upgrade phase\n2. Clear MOTD when upgrade completes\n3. Lock file acquired before upgrade, released after\n4. Status script created during setup, removed during cleanup\n5. Pre-reboot warning shown before each reboot","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-21T16:25:18.337553-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-21T16:40:19.26302-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-21T16:40:19.26302-05:00","close_reason":"Added lock file functions (upgrade_acquire_lock, upgrade_release_lock), progress display (upgrade_show_progress), reboot countdown warning (upgrade_warn_reboot), and status check script (upgrade_create_status_script).

{"id":"agentic_coding_flywheel_setup-lyf0","title":"Epic: Comprehensive lesson fact-checking against Dicklesworthstone tool repositories","description":"BACKGROUND AND METHODOLOGY\n==========================\nOn 2025-12-25, a comprehensive fact-checking initiative was undertaken to verify all lesson content in apps/web/components/lessons/ against the actual Dicklesworthstone tool repositories.\n\nMETHODOLOGY:\n1. Cloned all 7 tool repositories to /tmp/dicklesworthstone_tools/:\n   - cass (coding_agent_session_search) - Rust CLI\n   - cm (cass_memory_system) - TypeScript/Bun CLI\n   - bv (beads_viewer) - Go CLI with TUI\n   - ubs (ultimate_bug_scanner) - Go CLI\n   - slb (simultaneous_launch_button) - Go CLI\n   - caam (coding_agent_account_manager) - Go CLI\n   - agent_mail (mcp_agent_mail) - Python FastMCP\n\n2. Deep-dive analysis for each tool:\n   - Read comprehensive READMEs (some 1000+ lines)\n   - Examined actual CLI source code (main.go, *.ts, *.rs)\n   - Verified command flags and syntax against implementations\n   - Cross-referenced with AGENTS.md for consistency\n\n3. Compared lesson file content against tool documentation\n4. Created specific beads for each issue found with full context\n\nFINDINGS SUMMARY\n================\nLessons verified as accurate:\n- cass-lesson.tsx ✓ (Commands match README: health, search --robot, view, expand, capabilities, robot-docs guide)\n- cm-lesson.tsx ✓ (Commands verified: onboard status/sample/read/mark-done, playbook add, context)\n- beads-lesson.tsx ✓ (Commands correct: bd create, bd update, bd close, bv --robot-* flags)\n- agent-mail-lesson.tsx ✓ (MCP tool names verified: ensure_project, register_agent, send_message, file_reservation_paths, etc.)\n\nIssues found and fixed in earlier session:\n- SLB commands corrected (slb pending, slb run --reason, approve/reject syntax)\n- CAAM description changed from 'API keys' to 'OAuth tokens'\n- CAAM primary command changed from 'switch' to 'activate'\n- Deleted 3 duplicate lesson files with incorrect content\n- BV metrics enhanced with eigenvector, critical_path\n\nRemaining issue found:\n- safety-tools-lesson.tsx: CAAM uses 'list' but should be 'ls' (line 229 and 344)\n\nOVERARCHING GOALS\n=================\n1. The ACFS wizard teaches beginners who will use these exact commands\n2. Incorrect CLI syntax causes confusion when users reference official docs\n3. Command examples should match what users find in tool READMEs\n4.

{"id":"agentic_coding_flywheel_setup-mna","title":"Feature: Wizard Integration","description":"# Wizard Integration\n\n## Parent Epic\nWebapp Learning Hub (Part 2) - x04\n\n## Scope\nSeamlessly integrate the new Learning Hub with the existing 12-step wizard to create a cohesive user journey.\n\n## Current State\nStep 12 (`launch-onboarding/page.tsx`) currently:\n- Shows celebration confetti\n- Has \"Run onboard\" command card\n- Shows \"What you can do now\" quick reference\n- Links to `/workflow` as \"Part Two\"\n\n## Changes Needed\n\n### 1. Update Step 12 to Feature Learning Hub\nReplace the generic \"run onboard\" guidance with:\n- Prominent link to `/learn` as the primary CTA\n- Keep command card for CLI option (\"prefer hands-on?\")\n- Update \"Part Two\" messaging to mention both learning paths\n\nBefore:\n```\n[Confetti]\nStart the onboarding tutorial: `onboard`\n[Continue to Part Two: The Workflow]\n```\n\nAfter:\n```\n[Confetti]\nContinue your learning journey:\n[Primary CTA: Start Learning Hub]\n[Secondary: \"Prefer terminal? Run `onboard`\"]\n[Continue to Part Two: The Workflow]\n```\n\n### 2. Cross-Link Wizard Steps to Relevant Lessons\nAdd \"Learn more\" links from wizard steps to related lessons:\n\n| Wizard Step | Related Lesson |\n|-------------|----------------|\n| 6: SSH Into Your VPS | Lesson 2: SSH \u0026 Persistence |\n| 10: Reconnect as Ubuntu | Lesson 1: Linux Navigation |\n| 11: Status Check | Lesson 0: Welcome \u0026 Overview |\n| 12: Launch Onboarding | Learning Hub Dashboard |\n\n### 3. Cross-Link Lessons Back to Wizard\nIn lessons, add contextual references:\n- \"Not set up yet? [Start the wizard →](/wizard/os-selection)\"\n- \"Need to reconnect? [See SSH guide →](/wizard/ssh-connect)\"\n\n### 4. Unified Progress Indicator\nConsider showing combined progress in header/nav:\n- \"Setup: 12/12 ✓ | Learning: 4/9\"\n- Or unified: \"Progress: 16/21 steps complete\"\n\nThis is optional - might be over-engineering.\n\n## UX Considerations\n\n### Don't Break Existing Flow\nUsers who already use CLI onboard should not be confused. The webapp learning hub is an alternative path, not a replacement.\n\n### Smooth Transitions\nWhen linking between wizard and learn sections:\n- Use consistent styling\n- Clear breadcrumbs\n- Indicate which \"part\" user is in\n\n### Mobile Experience\nWizard is primarily desktop (requires terminal access). Learning hub should work great on mobile since it's read-only.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Step 12 prominently features Learning Hub CTA\n- [ ] CLI option still available for terminal enthusiasts\n- [ ] At least 3 wizard steps link to related lessons\n- [ ] Lessons have contextual back-links to wizard\n- [ ] Navigation clearly indicates current section\n\n## Dependencies\n- Requires: Learning Hub Core Infrastructure (tor)\n- Requires: Lesson Content Pages (cxk) - for cross-links to work\n\n## Blocked By\n- cxk (Lesson Content Pages) - need pages to exist before linking to them\n\n## Blocks\nNothing - this is the final integration step.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-21T18:18:21.076782-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-21T18:36:05.030043-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-21T18:36:05.030043-05:00","close_reason":"All acceptance criteria met: Step 12 has Learning Hub CTA, CLI option available, 3 wizard steps link to lessons (ssh-connect, status-check, reconnect-ubuntu), lessons back-link to wizard, clear navigation","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"agentic_coding_flywheel_setup-mna","depends_on_id":"agentic_coding_flywheel_setup-cxk","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-12-21T18:24:10.984712-05:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

{"id":"agentic_coding_flywheel_setup-q7r3","title":"[EPIC] First SSH Connection Experience","description":"# Epic: First SSH Connection Experience\n\n## Problem Statement\nThe first SSH connection is where the most beginners fail and abandon the process. Three critical issues:\n\n1. **\"Type yes\" terror**: The host authenticity warning looks like a SECURITY ALERT. Users are afraid to type \"yes\" because it looks like they're accepting malware.\n\n2. **Password confusion**: Users confuse their VPS provider account password (Hetzner login) with the VPS root password (set during VPS creation). These are DIFFERENT passwords.\n\n3. **Post-connection disorientation**: User successfully connects, sees \"root@vps:~#\", has no idea what this means or that they're now \"inside\" the VPS.\n\n## Background \u0026 Reasoning\nSSH is a completely foreign concept. \"Secure Shell\" means nothing to beginners. The mental model of \"remote controlling another computer through text\" is not intuitive.\n\nThe host authenticity prompt is particularly problematic because it uses security language (\"ECDSA key fingerprint\", \"Are you sure you want to continue?\") that sounds dangerous. Security-conscious users will hesitate; naive users will learn bad habits.\n\nThe password confusion is a classic support issue. Users try their Hetzner account password 3 times, get locked out, and panic.\n\n## User Story\nAs a beginner making my first SSH connection,\nI want clear guidance through each prompt and potential error,\nSo that I can successfully connect without fear or confusion.\n\n## Success Criteria\n1. User understands the \"type yes\" prompt is normal and safe\n2. User knows which password to use (VPS root, not provider account)\n3. User understands they're now \"inside\" the VPS after connecting\n4. User can verify they're on the VPS (e.g., run hostname)\n5. User knows how to disconnect (exit)\n\n## Scope\n- Enhance ssh-connect wizard page with more detailed guidance\n- Add prominent password clarification\n- Add post-connection verification step\n- Improve troubleshooting for common errors\n- Add mental model explanation for \"being inside\" the VPS\n\n## Dependencies\n- Epic A: Terminal Onboarding Foundation (user must understand terminal)\n- Epic B: SSH Key Generation (user must have generated key)\n\n## UI/UX Requirements\n- Maintain current polish for desktop and mobile\n- Password clarification should be PROMINENT, not buried in SimplerGuide\n- Use AlertCard for critical warnings (which password to use)\n- Consider showing the scary prompt so users recognize it\n\n## Technical Approach\n1. Add AlertCard above the SSH command explaining password distinction\n2. Add OutputPreview showing the \"type yes\" prompt with explanation\n3. Add post-connection verification: \"Try running: hostname\"\n4. Enhance troubleshooting with password-specific guidance\n5. Add \"You're now inside the VPS\" confirmation section\n\n## Estimated Effort\nMedium (1 wizard page major enhancement)\n\n## Priority Justification\nP0 (Critical) - This is the highest drop-off point in the wizard.

This transition has several pitfalls:\n\n1. **New SSH command format**: The reconnect command uses `-i ~/.ssh/acfs_ed25519` which is NEW. Users don't understand they're now using key auth instead of password.\n\n2. **Key auth failure**: If key auth doesn't work, they're stuck. No clear fallback path.\n\n3. **Powerlevel10k wizard surprise**: On first zsh login, p10k may launch a configuration wizard. This is unexpected and confusing.\n\n4. **Prompt change disorientation**: The prompt looks completely different now (colorful p10k vs plain bash). Users might think something is wrong.\n\n## Background \u0026 Reasoning\nThe root → ubuntu transition is a security best practice, but it creates a jarring experience. Users went from password auth as root to key auth as ubuntu. The shell also changes from bash to zsh with p10k theming.\n\nEach of these changes is an improvement, but together they make the VPS feel like a completely different machine. Users need preparation for these changes.\n\n## User Story\nAs a user reconnecting after installation,\nI want to understand the changes to my VPS,\nSo that I'm not confused by the new authentication method, shell, and prompt.\n\n## Success Criteria\n1. User understands the new SSH command uses their key\n2. User knows they won't need a password anymore\n3. User knows to press 'q' if p10k wizard appears\n4. User understands the colorful prompt is normal and good\n5. User has a fallback if key auth fails\n\n## Scope\n- Enhance reconnect-ubuntu page with key vs password explanation\n- Add p10k wizard handling instructions\n- Add \"Your prompt looks different now\" explanation\n- Add key auth troubleshooting\n- Add fallback instructions if key doesn't work\n\n## Dependencies\n- Epic F: Installation (user must have completed installation)\n\n## UI/UX Requirements\n- Maintain current polish for desktop and mobile\n- Key auth explanation should be clear but not overwhelming\n- P10k handling should be a GuideTip\n- Prompt change should include before/after visual\n\n## Technical Approach\n1. Add explanation of key auth vs password above SSH command\n2. Add GuideTip about p10k wizard (press q to skip)\n3. Add OutputPreview showing new prompt style\n4. Add troubleshooting section for key auth failures\n5.

{"id":"agentic_coding_flywheel_setup-t66c","title":"FEATURE: Wizard Password-First Flow Updates","description":"## Parent Epic\nagentic_coding_flywheel_setup-umqa (Beginner UX Overhaul v1.0)\n\n## Summary\n\nUpdate all wizard pages to reflect the new password-first SSH flow. This involves:\n- Simplifying the \"Create VPS\" page (no SSH key paste)\n- Adding explicit \"First Connection with Password\" guidance\n- Adding \"Verify Key-Based Connection\" step\n- Updating all SSH commands and expectations\n\n## Background \u0026 Motivation\n\nThe current wizard flow assumes users will paste their SSH key into the VPS provider's UI.\nThe audit revealed this is a critical failure point - users can't find where to paste the key.\n\nWith the installer now handling SSH key setup (see FEATURE: Installer SSH Key Integration),\nwe need to update the wizard to reflect this simpler flow:\n\n1. Create VPS → Just pick Ubuntu, note your password\n2. First connection → SSH with password (not key)\n3. Run installer → Installer prompts for key\n4. Verify → Disconnect and reconnect with key\n\n## Pages Requiring Updates\n\n### 1. /wizard/generate-ssh-key (Step 3)\n**Current**: \"Copy your public key for the next step\"\n**New**: \"Save your public key to notes - you'll paste it during installation\"\n\nChanges:\n- Add emphasis on SAVING the key, not just copying\n- Clarify that the key is used LATER, not immediately\n- Add note: \"Don't worry about pasting it into provider's website\"\n\n### 2. /wizard/create-vps (Step 5)\n**Current**: Has checklist including \"Pasted my SSH public key\"\n**New**: Simplified checklist focusing on password\n\nChanges:\n- Remove SSH key paste instruction\n- Add: \"Set a strong root password (write it down!)\"\n- Add: \"Note your server's IP address\"\n- Simplify to just: Ubuntu + password + IP\n\nProvider-specific guidance:\n- \"Skip any SSH key sections - we'll set that up later\"\n- \"If asked about authentication, choose 'Password'\"\n\n### 3. /wizard/ssh-connect (Step 6)\n**Current**: Uses key-based SSH command\n**New**: Uses password-based SSH command\n\nChanges:\n- Primary command: `ssh root@\u003cip\u003e` (no -i flag)\n- Add expectation: \"It will ask for your password\"\n- Update troubleshooting for password-based connection\n- Add note: \"This is the last time you'll need the password\"\n\n### 4. NEW: Installer Step (absorbs old Step 9)\nMove installer step earlier in flow (right after first connection).\n\nChanges:\n- Add note: \"The installer will ask for your SSH key\"\n- Add expectation: \"Have your public key ready to paste\"\n- Link back to where they saved their key\n\n### 5. NEW: /wizard/verify-key-connection (New Step)\nAfter installer runs, verify key-based connection works.\n\nContent:\n- \"Disconnect from your VPS: type `exit`\"\n- \"Now reconnect WITH your key:\"\n- Command: `ssh -i ~/.ssh/acfs_ed25519 ubuntu@\u003cip\u003e`\n- \"If this works without asking for password, you're all set!\"\n- Troubleshooting for common key issues\n\n### 6. /wizard/launch-onboarding (Final Step)\nAdd reconnection instructions prominently.\n\nChanges:\n- Add \"How to Get Back In\" section at top\n- Include both commands (key-based for ubuntu)\n- Add SSH config setup suggestion\n\n## Step Number Renumbering\n\nCurrent flow (12 steps):\n1. OS Selection\n2. Install Terminal\n3. Generate SSH Key\n4. Rent VPS\n5. Create VPS ← simplified\n6. SSH Connect ← password-based now\n7. Accounts\n8. Preflight Check\n9. Run Installer ← moves earlier\n10. Status Check\n11. Reconnect Ubuntu\n12. Launch Onboarding\n\nNew flow (proposed):\n1. OS Selection\n2. Install Terminal\n3. Generate SSH Key\n4. Rent VPS\n5. Create VPS (password-based)\n6. First Connection (password)\n7. Run Installer (prompts for key)\n8. Verify Key Connection (new)\n9. Accounts (simplified)\n10. Launch Onboarding (enhanced)\n\nNet reduction: 12 → 10 steps (cleaner!)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] /wizard/generate-ssh-key emphasizes saving key for later\n- [ ] /wizard/create-vps removes SSH key paste requirement\n- [ ] /wizard/ssh-connect uses password-based command\n- [ ] New verify-key-connection page exists\n- [ ] All step numbers updated\n- [ ] Progress indicator reflects new step count\n- [ ] All SimplerGuide sections updated for new flow\n- [ ] Troubleshooting sections updated\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- FEATURE: Installer SSH Key Integration (must be done first)\n  - The wizard updates assume the installer prompts for key\n\n## Design Considerations\n\n1. **Preserve Beginner Guidance**: Keep SimplerGuide sections but update content\n2. **Mobile Friendly**: Ensure all new pages work on mobile\n3. **No Breaking Changes to URLs**: Use redirects if step slugs change\n4. **Analytics Continuity**: Update step names in analytics tracking\n\n## Testing Plan\n\n1. Walk through entire wizard as complete beginner\n2. Test on new VPS with password-only setup\n3. Verify key verification step works\n4. Test with both Contabo and OVH\n5.

Learning dashboard page at `/learn`\n2. Lesson progress tracking system (hooks, localStorage)\n3. Lesson page layout/template with navigation\n4. MDX rendering pipeline for markdown content\n\n## Why This First\nThis is the foundation that all lesson pages depend on. Without the layout, progress tracking, and markdown rendering, we can't build individual lesson pages.\n\n## Technical Details\n\n### Dashboard Page (`/learn`)\n- Shows grid of 9 lesson cards with progress indicators (checkmark, current, locked)\n- Overall completion percentage with progress bar\n- Quick links to reference docs (commands, glossary)\n- \"Continue where you left off\" call-to-action\n- Uses existing card/grid patterns from wizard\n\n### Progress Tracking System\nSimilar pattern to existing `lib/wizardSteps.ts`:\n```typescript\n// lib/lessonProgress.ts\nexport const LESSONS = [\n  { id: 0, slug: 'welcome', title: 'Welcome \u0026 Overview', duration: '5 min' },\n  { id: 1, slug: 'linux-basics', title: 'Linux Navigation', duration: '8 min' },\n  // ... etc\n];\n\nexport function useCompletedLessons(): [number[], (lessonId: number) =\u003e void]\nexport function getLessonBySlug(slug: string): Lesson | undefined\n```\n\n### Lesson Layout\n- Sidebar with lesson list (like wizard stepper)\n- Main content area for MDX\n- Bottom navigation (Previous/Next, Mark Complete)\n- Reading time estimate\n- \"Try it\" callouts for hands-on exercises\n\n### MDX Pipeline\nOptions:\n1. `@next/mdx` - Built-in, simple but limited\n2. `next-mdx-remote` - More flexible, can load from file system\n3. `contentlayer` - Type-safe, best DX but more setup\n\nRecommendation: `next-mdx-remote` for flexibility without complexity.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] `/learn` page shows dashboard with 9 lesson cards\n- [ ] Clicking lesson card navigates to `/learn/[slug]`\n- [ ] Progress persists in localStorage\n- [ ] Lesson layout has consistent navigation\n- [ ] MDX files render with proper styling\n\n## Dependencies\nNone - this is foundational.\n\n## Blocked By\nNothing - can start immediately.\n\n## Blocks\n- Lesson Content Pages (need infrastructure first)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-21T18:17:05.606187-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-21T18:24:54.003504-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-21T18:24:54.003504-05:00","close_reason":"Completed Learning Hub core infrastructure: dashboard, lesson pages, progress tracking, markdown rendering"}
{"id":"agentic_coding_flywheel_setup-trkz","title":"FEATURE: Post-Installation Onboarding Experience","description":"## Parent Epic\nagentic_coding_flywheel_setup-umqa (Beginner UX Overhaul v1.0)\n\n## Summary\n\nCreate a comprehensive \"first 5 minutes\" experience for users who have just completed installation.\nThis addresses the critical \"now what?\" gap identified in the UX audit where users complete setup\nbut don't know what to do next.\n\n## Background \u0026 Motivation\n\nThe audit revealed that after reaching the \"Congratulations!\" page, users are left without\nclear guidance. They see commands like \\`cc\\` but don't know:\n\n1. That they need to authenticate first (\\`claude\\` command opens browser)\n2. What folder to be in when starting\n3. What to actually ask the AI to do\n4. How to get back in if they close their laptop\n5. How their tmux sessions work\n\nThis feature creates a guided, hand-holding experience for the crucial first minutes.\n\n## Components\n\n### 1. \"Your First 5 Minutes\" Walkthrough\n\nA step-by-step section on /wizard/launch-onboarding that guides users through:\n\n#### Step 1: Create Your First Project Folder\n\\`\\`\\`bash\nmkdir ~/my-first-project \u0026\u0026 cd ~/my-first-project\n\\`\\`\\`\n**Why**: Establishes that work happens in folders, not random locations.\n\n#### Step 2: Authenticate Claude\n\\`\\`\\`bash\nclaude\n\\`\\`\\`\n**Expectation**: \"A browser window will open. Log in with your Anthropic account.\"\n**What to do**: \"Complete login in browser, then return to terminal.\"\n**Success**: \"You should see 'Welcome to Claude Code' in terminal.\"\n\n#### Step 3: Start Claude Code\n\\`\\`\\`bash\ncc\n\\`\\`\\`\n**Note**: \"This is the shortcut for \\`claude code\\` after authentication.\"\n\n#### Step 4: Your First Prompt\n\u003e Create a simple Python script that prints \"Hello from AI!\" and run it\n\n**What to watch for**:\n- Claude creates a file called \\`hello.py\\`\n- Claude writes the code\n- Claude runs the script\n- You see \"Hello from AI!\" in the output\n\n#### Step 5: Celebrate!\n🎉 You just used AI to write and run code!\n\n### 2. Authentication Expectations\n\nFor each agent (Claude, Codex, Gemini), clearly explain:\n- What command triggers auth\n- What happens (browser opens)\n- What to do (complete login, return to terminal)\n- How to verify it worked\n\nInclude screenshots/mockups of the auth flow.\n\n### 3. Reconnection Instructions\n\nProminent section (not buried in SimplerGuide) explaining:\n\n#### \"How to Get Back In\"\n\nWhen you close your terminal or laptop:\n\n1. **Open terminal** on your computer\n2. **Reconnect to your VPS**:\n   \\`\\`\\`bash\n   ssh -i ~/.ssh/acfs_ed25519 ubuntu@YOUR_IP\n   \\`\\`\\`\n3. **Resume your session** (if using NTM):\n   \\`\\`\\`bash\n   ntm attach myproject\n   \\`\\`\\`\n   This brings back exactly where you left off!\n\n#### SSH Config for Easy Access\n\nShow how to set up ~/.ssh/config:\n\\`\\`\\`\nHost myserver\n    HostName YOUR_IP\n    User ubuntu\n    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/acfs_ed25519\n\\`\\`\\`\nThen just: \\`ssh myserver\\`\n\n### 4. NTM Quick Orientation\n\nBrief explanation of what NTM is and why it matters:\n- \"Your work persists even when you disconnect\"\n- \"Like browser tabs, but for terminal sessions\"\n- Key commands: \\`ntm new\\`, \\`ntm list\\`, \\`ntm attach\\`\n\n## UI/UX Design\n\n### Layout on Launch Onboarding Page\n\n1. **Celebration Header** (keep existing confetti)\n2. **\"Your First 5 Minutes\"** card (NEW, prominent)\n3. **\"Getting Back In\"** card (NEW, prominent)  \n4. **Quick Reference** cards (existing, but after the new sections)\n5. **Learning Hub CTA** (keep existing)\n\n### Visual Treatment\n\n- Number each step clearly (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n- Use command cards with copy buttons\n- Show expected output previews\n- Use success checkmarks for completed steps (optional: track in localStorage)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] \"Your First 5 Minutes\" section exists with 5 clear steps\n- [ ] Each step has command, explanation, and expected result\n- [ ] Authentication expectation is set before \\`cc\\` command\n- [ ] \"Getting Back In\" section prominently placed\n- [ ] SSH config setup instructions included\n- [ ] NTM basics briefly explained\n- [ ] Mobile-friendly layout\n- [ ] All commands have copy buttons\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- FEATURE: Wizard Password-First Flow Updates\n  - Need updated wizard flow before finalizing this page\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n- Users complete \"first 5 minutes\" (track via analytics)\n- Reduced support questions about \"how do I get back in\"\n- Time to first Claude interaction measured\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\nThis is primarily a content and UI task - no backend changes needed.\nUse existing components (CommandCard, AlertCard, SimplerGuide).\n\n## Testing Plan\n\n1. New user walkthrough - can they complete all 5 steps?\n2. Disconnect and reconnect - do instructions work?\n3. NTM session recovery - does it work as described?\n4.

One stale checksum on tool #8 wastes all progress from tools 1-7.\n\n## Business Impact\n- Checksum mismatches are usually legitimate updates, not attacks\n- Not all tools equally critical: missing ntm is annoying; missing bun is blocking\n- Completed phases should not be wasted by tool #9 failing\n\n## Technical Approach\n1.

{"id":"agentic_coding_flywheel_setup-umqa","title":"EPIC: Beginner UX Overhaul v1.0 - Password-First SSH Flow","description":"## Overview\n\nThis epic addresses the critical UX issues identified in STEP_BY_STEP_AUDIT_OF_USER_EXPERIENCE.md that cause\nbeginner users to abandon the setup process. The core innovation is switching from \"SSH key during VPS creation\"\nto \"password-first connection with installer-managed key setup.\"\n\n## The Core Problem\n\nThe current flow requires users to paste their SSH public key into the VPS provider's UI during server creation.\nThis fails because:\n\n1. **Provider UI Variance**: Contabo, OVH, DigitalOcean, etc. all have different interfaces\n2. **Hidden SSH Key Fields**: Users can't find where to paste the key\n3. **Timing Issues**: Some providers require key during creation, others after\n4. **No Verification**: If the key is pasted wrong, user gets cryptic \"Permission denied\" errors\n5. **Brittle**: Any change to provider UI breaks our instructions\n\n## The Solution: Password-First Flow\n\nInstead of relying on provider UIs, we use a universal approach:\n\n1. **User creates VPS with password** (every provider supports this reliably)\n2. **User SSHs as root with password**: `ssh root@\u003cip\u003e` (standard, no special keys)\n3. **Installer prompts for SSH public key** (we control this experience)\n4. **Installer installs key and migrates to ubuntu user** (existing migrate_ssh_keys works)\n5. **User verifies key-based connection** (closes loop, proves it works)\n\n## Why This Is Better\n\n- **Universal**: Works with ANY VPS provider without specific instructions\n- **Controlled**: We own the key installation process, not the provider\n- **Verifiable**: We can validate the key and confirm it works\n- **Recoverable**: If something goes wrong, user is still connected and can retry\n- **Simpler**: \"Just pick Ubuntu and get a password\" is easier than \"find the SSH key section\"\n\n## Revised User Journey\n\n### Phase 1: Local Setup (unchanged)\n1. Choose OS\n2. Install terminal\n3. Generate SSH key → **SAVE TO NOTES** (emphasized)\n\n### Phase 2: VPS Creation (simplified)\n4. Rent VPS (pick provider/plan)\n5. Create VPS → **Ubuntu + root password** (skip SSH key entirely)\n\n### Phase 3: First Connection (new approach)\n6. SSH as root with password → `ssh root@\u003cip\u003e`\n7. Run installer → **Installer prompts for SSH key**\n8. Verify key connection → Disconnect, reconnect with key\n\n### Phase 4: Post-Setup (enhanced)\n9. Essential accounts only (GitHub, Claude)\n10. \"Your First 5 Minutes\" guided walkthrough\n11. Reconnection instructions + SSH config setup\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n- **Completion Rate**: Track % of users who reach launch-onboarding\n- **SSH Error Rate**: Reduce \"Permission denied\" support requests\n- **Time to First Success**: Measure time from start to first Claude interaction\n\n## Technical Scope\n\nThis epic includes:\n- Installer modifications for SSH key prompting\n- Wizard page updates for password-first flow\n- Accounts page simplification\n- Post-installation onboarding enhancements\n- Installer UX improvements (progress indicators)\n- Documentation updates\n\n## Dependencies\n\nNone - this is a foundational epic.\n\n## Risks \u0026 Mitigations\n\n| Risk | Mitigation |\n|------|------------|\n| Password auth less secure than key-only | Key is installed immediately during first session |\n| User forgets password | Password is only needed once, then key takes over |\n| Some providers don't give root access | Fallback to ubuntu user with password works similarly |\n| Pasting long key in terminal fails | ED25519 keys are short (~100 chars), add validation |\n\n## Estimated Effort\n\n- Installer changes: 4-6 hours\n- Wizard page updates: 8-12 hours\n- Post-installation UX: 6-8 hours\n- Testing across providers: 4-6 hours\n- Documentation: 4-6 hours\n\n**Total: ~30-40 hours of focused work**","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-21T19:14:44.321974-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-21T19:29:43.625364-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-21T19:29:43.625364-05:00","close_reason":"Design document is complete.

{"id":"agentic_coding_flywheel_setup-ux1f","title":"[EPIC] Terminal Onboarding Foundation","description":"# Epic: Terminal Onboarding Foundation\n\n## Problem Statement\nOur wizard assumes users know how to use a terminal. They don't. When a complete beginner downloads and opens Ghostty/WezTerm, they see a blank screen with a blinking cursor and have NO IDEA what to do. This is the #1 reason beginners abandon the setup process.\n\n## Background \u0026 Reasoning\nThe terminal is the foundational interface for everything in ACFS. Every subsequent step (SSH key generation, SSH connection, running the installer, using agents) requires terminal proficiency. Without this foundation, users cannot proceed.\n\nCurrently we tell users to \"install a terminal\" and immediately jump to \"run this SSH command.\" This assumes knowledge of:\n- What a prompt is ($ or %)\n- That you type after the prompt\n- How to copy/paste in a terminal (different from regular apps!)\n- How to press Enter to execute\n- How to recognize success vs failure\n\n## User Story\nAs a complete beginner who has never used a command line,\nI want to understand the basics of terminal interaction,\nSo that I can confidently execute the commands in the wizard.\n\n## Success Criteria\n1. User can open terminal and identify the prompt\n2. User can type a simple command and press Enter\n3. User can copy a command from the wizard and paste it into terminal\n4. User can recognize when a command succeeded vs failed\n5. User feels confident, not scared, when looking at the terminal\n\n## Scope\n- Add \"Terminal Basics\" micro-lesson after terminal installation step\n- Include interactive verification (type echo hello, see hello)\n- Explain copy/paste differences by OS\n- Explain the prompt ($ vs %) and what it means\n- Visual examples with screenshots or animations\n\n## Dependencies\nNone - this is the foundational epic that other improvements depend on.\n\n## Blocks\n- SSH Key Generation improvements\n- SSH Connection improvements  \n- All subsequent terminal-based steps\n\n## Technical Approach\nAdd a new wizard step or expand the \"Install Terminal\" step to include a \"Try Your First Commands\" section with:\n- SimplerGuide component explaining prompts\n- Interactive checklist with verification commands\n- Copy/paste instructions per OS\n- Success state showing \"You're ready to continue!\"\n\n## Estimated Effort\nMedium (2-3 wizard page updates, new content)\n\n## Priority Justification\nP0 (Critical) - Without this, all other wizard improvements are moot.

Go installation is reliable (official binary)\n\n## Implementation\n\n```bash\nis_critical_tool() {\n    local tool=\"$1\"\n    for critical in \"${CRITICAL_TOOLS[@]}\"; do\n        [[ \"$tool\" == \"$critical\" ]] \u0026\u0026 return 0\n    done\n    return 1\n}\n\nhandle_tool_failure() {\n    local tool=\"$1\"\n    local error=\"$2\"\n    \n    if is_critical_tool \"$tool\"; then\n        log_error \"CRITICAL tool failed: $tool\"\n        log_error \"$error\"\n        log_error \"Installation cannot continue.\"\n        exit 1\n    else\n        log_warn \"Optional tool failed: $tool\"\n        log_warn \"$error\"\n        SKIPPED_TOOLS+=(\"$tool\")\n    fi\n}\n```\n\n## Non-Interactive Behavior\n\nWhen running non-interactively (CI, agents):\n- CRITICAL tool checksum mismatch → ABORT\n- RECOMMENDED tool checksum mismatch → AUTO-SKIP with warning\n\n## Dependencies\n- Used by: checksum mismatch handler (agentic_coding_flywheel_setup-4jr)\n- Used by: error reporting (agentic_coding_flywheel_setup-5zm)\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] CRITICAL_TOOLS array defined with: mise, uv, bun, go, git, curl\n- [ ] RECOMMENDED_TOOLS array for everything else\n- [ ] is_critical_tool() helper function\n- [ ] handle_tool_failure() respects classification\n- [ ] Non-interactive mode auto-skips RECOMMENDED, aborts on CRITICAL","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-21T12:44:36.267827-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-21T14:43:26.105479-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-21T14:43:26.105479-05:00","close_reason":"Created scripts/lib/tools.sh with CRITICAL_TOOLS (git, curl, bun, uv, go, zsh, mise, rustup, cargo) and RECOMMENDED_TOOLS arrays.

They don't know the installer keeps running.\n\n2. **Wall of text confusion**: Lots of output scrolling by. They don't know if it's working, failing, or what any of it means.\n\n3. **curl | bash skepticism**: Security-aware users worry about piping curl to bash. The \"View source\" link exists but isn't prominent enough.\n\n4. **Command gibberish**: `-fsSL` means nothing to them.\n\n## Background \u0026 Reasoning\nLong-running installations are inherently risky for beginners. Any unexpected behavior triggers panic. The installer IS idempotent and resilient, but users don't know that.\n\nWe need to:\n1. Set expectations BEFORE they run the command\n2. Explain what they'll see DURING installation\n3. Provide clear recovery instructions IF something goes wrong\n4. Address security concerns proactively\n\n## User Story\nAs a beginner running the installer,\nI want to understand what's happening and what to do if something goes wrong,\nSo that I can wait patiently and recover from any issues.\n\n## Success Criteria\n1. User knows that disconnection is recoverable (just SSH back in)\n2. User understands progress indicators (green checkmarks = good)\n3. User knows to wait for \"Installation complete\" message\n4. User can find and understand the install script source\n5. User understands the curl command parts at a high level\n\n## Scope\n- Add disconnection recovery instructions prominently\n- Add \"What you'll see\" section explaining output format\n- Make \"View source\" more prominent for security-conscious users\n- Add optional command breakdown for curious users\n- Consider adding a \"If something fails\" troubleshooting section\n\n## Dependencies\n- Epic D: First SSH Connection (user must be connected)\n\n## UI/UX Requirements\n- Maintain current polish for desktop and mobile\n- Disconnection warning should be AlertCard variant=\"warning\"\n- Output explanation should use OutputPreview component\n- Source link should be visually distinct (security/trust badge)\n\n## Technical Approach\n1. Add AlertCard about disconnection recovery near top\n2. Add OutputPreview showing example progress output\n3. Add expandable \"What is this command doing?\" with breakdown\n4. Enhance \"View source\" with trust badge styling\n5. Add GuideCaution for \"If installation seems stuck\"\n\n## Estimated Effort\nSmall-Medium (1 wizard page enhancement)\n\n## Priority Justification\nP1 (High) - Installation failure/abandonment means complete user loss.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-22T13:35:47.401107-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-22T14:57:18.94433-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-22T14:57:18.94433-05:00","close_reason":"Implemented command breakdown section explaining curl flags, | bash piping, and --yes/--mode options.

This serves as \"Part 2\" of the user journey after the 12-step installation wizard.\n\n## Problem Statement\nCurrently, Step 12 of the wizard (\"Launch Onboarding\") tells users to run `onboard` in their terminal. This creates a fragmented experience:\n- Users must context-switch from web to CLI\n- Lesson progress isn't visible in the webapp\n- Content isn't searchable/bookmarkable in the web\n- Users can't read lessons on mobile while SSHed from laptop\n\n## Goals\n1. Provide all 9 onboard lessons in the webapp at `/learn/[slug]`\n2. Enable progress tracking with localStorage persistence\n3. Create a learning dashboard at `/learn` showing overall progress\n4. Add reference documentation (commands, tools, glossary)\n5. Integrate seamlessly with existing wizard (cross-links, continuity)\n\n## Success Metrics\n- Users can complete all 9 lessons in webapp\n- Progress persists across sessions\n- Pages are SEO-friendly and shareable\n- Mobile-responsive for reading on the go\n\n## Design Principles\n1. **Complement, don't duplicate** - Web is for reading/reference, CLI for hands-on\n2. **Single source of truth** - Markdown files in `acfs/onboard/lessons/` are canonical\n3. **Progressive disclosure** - Beginners see simple content, depth available on demand\n4. **Consistent with existing patterns** - Reuse SimplerGuide, CommandCard, Jargon components\n\n## Out of Scope (Future Enhancements)\n- Progress sync between CLI and webapp (complex, needs API)\n- Interactive terminal emulator\n- Video content production\n- Quizzes/assessments\n- Certification/badges\n\n## Technical Approach\n- Use Next.js App Router with `/learn/[slug]` dynamic routes\n- MDX for rendering markdown with React components\n- TanStack Query for state management (like existing wizard)\n- localStorage for progress persistence\n\n## Related\n- Wizard Step 12 (launch-onboarding/page.tsx) - current hand-off point\n- CLI onboard tool (packages/onboard/) - 9 lessons\n- Workflow page (/workflow) - advanced multi-agent documentation","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-21T18:16:20.154822-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-21T18:39:38.96766-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-21T18:39:38.96766-05:00","close_reason":"Learning Hub Part 2 complete: 9 lessons at /learn/[slug], progress tracking, dashboard at /learn, reference docs (agent-commands, glossary, ntm-palette), wizard integration all implemented"}
