const PROMPT_BEST_OF_ALL_WORLDS = `I asked 3 competing LLMs to do the exact same thing and they came up with pretty different plans which you can read below. I want you to REALLY carefully analyze their plans with an open mind and be intellectually honest about what they did that's better than your plan. Then I want you to come up with the best possible revisions to your plan (you should simply update your existing document for your original plan with the revisions) that artfully and skillfully blends the "best of all worlds" to create a true, ultimate, superior hybrid version of the plan that best achieves our stated goals and will work the best in real-world practice to solve the problems we are facing and our overarching goals while ensuring the extreme success of the enterprise as best as possible; you should provide me with a complete series of git-diff style changes to your original plan to turn it into the new, enhanced, much longer and detailed plan that integrates the best of all the plans with every good idea included (you don't need to mention which ideas came from which models in the final revised enhanced plan):`;

const PROMPT_100_IDEAS = `OK so now I want you to come up with your top 10 most brilliant ideas for adding extremely powerful and cool functionality that will make this system far more compelling, useful, intuitive, versatile, powerful, robust, reliable, etc for the users. Use ultrathink. But be pragmatic and don't think of features that will be extremely hard to implement or which aren't necessarily worth the additional complexity burden they would introduce. But I don't want you to just think of 10 ideas: I want you to seriously think hard and come up with one HUNDRED ideas and then only tell me your 10 VERY BEST and most brilliant, clever, and radically innovative and powerful ideas.`;

const PROMPT_CREATE_BEADS = `OK so please take ALL of that and elaborate on it more and then create a comprehensive and granular set of beads for all this with tasks, subtasks, and dependency structure overlaid, with detailed comments so that the whole thing is totally self-contained and self-documenting (including relevant background, reasoning/justification, considerations, etc.-- anything we'd want our "future self" to know about the goals and intentions and thought process and how it serves the over-arching goals of the project.) Use ultrathink.`;

const PROMPT_REVIEW_BEADS = `Check over each bead super carefully-- are you sure it makes sense? Is it optimal? Could we change anything to make the system work better for users? If so, revise the beads. It's a lot easier and faster to operate in "plan space" before we start implementing these things! Use ultrathink.`;

const PROMPT_AGENT_SWARM = `First read ALL of the AGENTS.md file and README.md file super carefully and understand ALL of both! Then use your code investigation agent mode to fully understand the code, and technical architecture and purpose of the project. Then register with MCP Agent Mail and introduce yourself to the other agents. Be sure to check your agent mail and to promptly respond if needed to any messages; then proceed meticulously with your next assigned beads, working on the tasks systematically and meticulously and tracking your progress via beads and agent mail messages. Don't get stuck in "communication purgatory" where nothing is getting done; be proactive about starting tasks that need to be done, but inform your fellow agents via messages when you do so and mark beads appropriately. When you're not sure what to do next, use the bv tool mentioned in AGENTS.md to prioritize the best beads to work on next; pick the next one that you can usefully work on and get started. Make sure to acknowledge all communication requests from other agents and that you are aware of all active agents and their names. Use ultrathink.`;

// Daily maintenance prompts
const PROMPT_RANDOMLY_INSPECT = `I want you to sort of randomly explore the code files in this project, choosing code files to deeply investigate and understand and trace their functionality and execution flows through the related code files which they import or which they are imported by. Once you understand the purpose of the code in the larger context of the workflows, I want you to do a super careful, methodical, and critical check with "fresh eyes" to find any obvious bugs, problems, errors, issues, silly mistakes, etc. and then systematically and meticulously and intelligently correct them. Be sure to comply with ALL rules in AGENTS.md and ensure that any code you write or revise conforms to the best practice guides referenced in the AGENTS.md file.`;

const PROMPT_CHECK_OTHER_AGENTS = `Ok can you now turn your attention to reviewing the code written by your fellow agents and checking for any issues, bugs, errors, problems, inefficiencies, security problems, reliability issues, etc. and carefully diagnose their underlying root causes using first-principle analysis and then fix or revise them if necessary? Don't restrict yourself to the latest commits, cast a wider net and go super deep! Use ultrathink.`;

const PROMPT_FRESH_REVIEW = `Great, now I want you to carefully read over all of the new code you just wrote and other existing code you just modified with "fresh eyes" looking super carefully for any obvious bugs, errors, problems, issues, confusion, etc. Carefully fix anything you uncover.`;

const PROMPT_SCRUTINIZE_UI = `Great, now I want you to super carefully scrutinize every aspect of the application workflow and implementation and look for things that just seem sub-optimal or even wrong/mistaken to you, things that could very obviously be improved from a user-friendliness and intuitiveness standpoint, places where our UI/UX could be improved and polished to be slicker, more visually appealing, and more premium feeling and just ultra high quality, like Stripe-level apps.`;

const PROMPT_WORK_ON_BEADS = `OK, so start systematically and methodically and meticulously and diligently executing those remaining beads tasks that you created in the optimal logical order! Don't forget to mark beads as you work on them.`;

const PROMPT_GIT_COMMIT = `Now, based on your knowledge of the project, commit all changed files now in a series of logically connected groupings with super detailed commit messages for each and then push. Take your time to do it right. Don't edit the code at all. Don't commit obviously ephemeral files. Use ultrathink.`;

const PROMPT_NEXT_BEAD = `Pick the next bead you can actually do usefully now and start coding on it immediately; communicate what you're working on to your fellow agents and mark beads appropriately as you work. And respond to any agent mail messages you've received.`;

const PROMPT_ANALYZE_BEADS = `Re-read AGENTS.md first. Then, can you try using bv to get some insights on what each agent should most usefully work on? Then share those insights with the other agents via agent mail and strongly suggest in your messages the optimal work for each one and explain how/why you came up with that using bv. Use ultrathink.`;

const PROMPT_LEVERAGE_TANSTACK = `Ok I want you to look through the ENTIRE project and look for areas where, if we leveraged one of the many TanStack libraries (e.g., query, table, forms, etc), we could make part of the code much better, simpler, more performant, more maintainable, elegant, shorter, more reliable, etc.`;

const PROMPT_BUILD_UI_UX = `I also want you to do a spectacular job building absolutely world-class UI/UX components, with an intense focus on making the most visually appealing, user-friendly, intuitive, slick, polished, "Stripe level" of quality UI/UX possible for this that leverages the good libraries that are already part of the project.`;

// Additional Analysis & Development prompts
const PROMPT_FIX_BUG = `I want you to very carefully diagnose and then fix the root underlying cause of the bugs/errors shown here, but fix them FOR REAL, not a superficial "bandaid" fix! Here are the details:`;

const PROMPT_CHECK_ORM_SCHEMAS = `Now reread AGENTS.md, read your README.md, and then I want you to use ultrathink to super carefully and critically read the entire data ORM schema/models and look for any issues or problems, conceptual mistakes, logical errors, or anything that doesn't fit your understanding of the business strategy and accepted best practices for the design and architecture of databases for these sorts of ecommerce/saas projects/companies.`;

const PROMPT_APPLY_UBS = `Read about the ubs tool in AGENTS.md. Now run UBS and investigate and fix literally every single UBS issue once you determine (after reasoned consideration and close inspection) that it's legit.`;

const PROMPT_CREATE_TESTS = `Do we have full unit test coverage without using mocks/fake stuff? What about complete e2e integration test scripts with great, detailed logging? If not, then create a comprehensive and granular set of beads for all this with tasks, subtasks, and dependency structure overlaid with detailed comments.`;

// Documentation prompts
const PROMPT_COMPLETE_DOCS = `Now I need you to look through the existing documentation in our docusaurus site here and look for the (many, many) instances of functionality in our project that are not described or explained at all yet (or explained inadequately) in the docusaurus site, and then create and expand the documentation in the site to cover these in an exhaustive, intuitive, helpful, useful, pragmatic way. Don't just make a dump of methods, parameters, etc. Add actually well-written narrative explaining what the stuff does, how it is organized, etc. to help another developer understand how it all works so that they can usefully contribute to the system.`;

const PROMPT_IMPROVE_README = `What else can we put in there to make the README longer and more detailed about what we built, why it's useful, how it works, the algorithms/design principles used, etc. This is incremental NEW content, not replacement for what is there already.`;

// Git & Operations prompts
const PROMPT_DO_GH_FLOW = `Do all the GitHub stuff: commit, deploy, create tag, bump version, release, monitor gh actions, compute checksums, etc.`;

const PROMPT_DO_ALL_OF_IT = `OK, please do ALL of that now. Track work via bd beads (no markdown TODO lists): create/claim/update/close beads as you go so nothing gets lost, and keep communicating via Agent Mail when you start/finish work.`;

// Agent Coordination prompts
const PROMPT_CHECK_MAIL = `Be sure to check your agent mail and to promptly respond if needed to any messages, and also acknowledge any contact requests; make sure you know the names of all active agents using the MCP Agent Mail system.`;

const PROMPT_INTRODUCE_TO_AGENTS = `Before doing anything else, read ALL of AGENTS.md, then register with MCP Agent Mail and introduce yourself to the other agents.`;

const PROMPT_START_WITH_MAIL = `Be sure to check your agent mail and to promptly respond if needed to any messages; then proceed meticulously with your next assigned beads, working on the tasks systematically and meticulously and tracking your progress via beads and agent mail messages. Don't get stuck in "communication purgatory" where nothing is getting done; be proactive about starting tasks that need to be done, but inform your fellow agents via messages when you do so and mark beads appropriately. When you're really not sure what to do, pick the next bead that you can usefully work on and get started. Make sure to acknowledge all communication requests from other agents and that you are aware of all active agents and their names. Use ultrathink.`;

// Investigation prompts
const PROMPT_READ_AND_INVESTIGATE = `First read ALL of the AGENTS.md file and README.md file super carefully and understand ALL of both! Then use your code investigation agent mode to fully understand the code, and technical architecture and purpose of the project.`;

const PROMPT_REREAD_AGENTS = `Reread AGENTS.md so it's still fresh in your mind.`;

const PROMPT_USE_BV = `Use bv with the robot flags (see AGENTS.md for info on this) to find the most impactful bead(s) to work on next and then start on it. Remember to mark the beads appropriately and communicate with your fellow agents.`;

            <GuideTip>
              <strong>Start small.</strong> Begin with 2-3 agents to understand the workflow.
              Scale up to 8-10+ agents as you get comfortable. More agents = faster progress,
              but also more coordination overhead.

              <strong>Test coverage is crucial!</strong> This autopilot approach only works
              safely when you have comprehensive unit tests and e2e integration tests. The
              tests act as guardrails preventing agents from breaking things.

            <GuideExplain term="Why a separate setup script?">
              The main ACFS installer focuses on development tools. This second script
              handles cloud service configuration, which requires your specific accounts
              and API keys. Running them separately keeps the initial setup fast and
              lets you configure cloud services when you&apos;re ready.
